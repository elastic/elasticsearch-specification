# Elasticsearch Specification

This repository contains the Elasticsearch request/response definitions in TypeScript,
you can find them inside [`/specification`](./specification).
The [`/compiler`](./compiler) folder contains a TypeScript program that compiles the entire definition
in a JSON representation that can be used for generating language clients.

This JSON representation is formally defined by [a set of TypeScript definitions (a meta-model)](./compiler/model/metamodel.ts)
that also explains the various properties and their values.

## Prepare the environment

For generating the JSON representation and running the validation code you need
to install and configure Node.js in your development environment.

You can install Node.js with [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Once the installation is completed, install Node.js with `nvm`:

```sh
# this command will install the version configured in .nvmrc
nvm use
```

## How to generate the JSON representation

```
# clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification.git

# install the dependencies
$ make setup

# generate the JSON representation
$ make spec-generate

# the generated output can be found in ./output/schema/schema.json
$ cat output/schema/schema.json
```

## Make Targets

  make <target>
  validate         Validate a given endpoint request or response

### Structure of the JSON representation

The JSON representation is [formally defined as TypeScript definitions](./compiler/model/metamodel.ts).
Refer to them for the full details. It is an object with two top level keys:

```jsonc
{
  "types": [...],
  "endpoints": [...]
}
```

The first one, `types`, contains all the type definitions from the specification, such as
`IndexRequest` or `MainError`, while the second one, `endpoints`, contains every
endpoint of Elasticsearch and the respective type mapping. For example:

```jsonc
{
  "types": [    {
    "attachedBehaviors": [
      "CommonQueryParameters"
    ],
    "body": {
      "kind": "value",
      "value": {
        "kind": "instance_of",
        "type": {
          "name": "TDocument",
          "namespace": "_global.index"
        }
      }
    },
    "generics": [
      {
        "name": "TDocument",
        "namespace": "_global.index"
      }
    ],
    "inherits": {
      "type": {
        "name": "RequestBase",
        "namespace": "_types"
      }
    },
    "kind": "request",
    "name": {
      "name": "Request",
      "namespace": "_global.index"
    },
    "path": [...],
    "query": [...]
  }, {
    "inherits": {
      "type": {
        "name": "WriteResponseBase",
        "namespace": "_types"
      }
    },
    "kind": "response",
    "name": {
      "name": "Response",
      "namespace": "_global.index"
    }
  }],
  "endpoints": [{
      "accept": [
        "application/json"
      ],
      "contentType": [
        "application/json"
      ],
      "description": "Creates or updates a document in an index.",
      "docUrl": "https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/docs-index_.html",
      "name": "index",
      "request": {
        "name": "Request",
        "namespace": "_global.index"
      },
      "requestBodyRequired": true,
      "response": {
        "name": "Response",
        "namespace": "_global.index"
      },
      "since": "0.0.0",
      "stability": "stable",
      "urls": [...],
      "visibility": "public"
    }]
}
```

The example above represents the [index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-index_.html)
request, inside the `endpoints` array you can find the API name and the type mappings under `request.name`
and `response.name`. The respective type definitons can be found inside the `types` array.

In some cases an endpoint might be defined, but there is no a type definition yet, in such case
the `request` and `response` value will be `null`.

## How to validate the specification

The specification is validated daily by the [client-flight-recorder](https://github.com/elastic/clients-flight-recorder) project.
The validation result can be found [here](https://github.com/elastic/clients-flight-recorder/blob/dev/recordings/types-validation/types-validation.md).

### Validate the specification in your machine

The following step only apply if you don't have `~/.elastic/github.token` in place.

Create GitHub token to allow authentication with [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
  * Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens.
  * Click `Generate new token`.
  * Give your token a name and make sure to click the `repo` and `read:org` scopes.
  * Create a file at `~/.elastic/github.token` and paste the GitHub token into it.
  * Change permissions on the file allow access only from the user.
     `chmod 600 ~/.elastic/github.token`

You can see [here](https://github.com/elastic/infra/tree/master/docs/vault#github-auth)
how to generate a token.

Once you have configured the environment, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification.git
git clone https://github.com/elastic/clients-flight-recorder.git

cd elasticsearch-specification
# this will validate the xpack.info request type agains the 8.1.0 stack version
make validate api=xpack.info type=request stack-version=8.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```

The last command above will install all the dependencies and run, download
the test recordings and finally validate the specification.
If you need to download the recordings again, run `make validate-no-cache api=xpack.info type=request stack-version=8.1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

Once you see the errors, you can fix the original definition in `/specification`
and then run the command again until the types validator does not trigger any new error.
Finally open a pull request with your changes.

## FAQ

### A specific property is not always present, how do I define it?

When you define a property the syntax is `propertyName: propertyType`.
By default a property is required to exist. If you know that a property will not
always be there, you can add a question mark just before the column:

```ts
propertyRequired: string
propertyOptional?: string
```

### A definition is missing, how do I add it?

See [here](./docs/add-new-api.md).

### A definition is not correct, how do I fix it?

All the definitons are inside `/specification` folder, search the bad defintion and update it,
you can find above how to run the validation of the spec.

### An endpoint is missing, how do I add it?

See [here](./docs/add-new-api.md).

### An endpoint definition is not correct, how do I fix it?

All the endpoint definitons are inside `/specification/_json_spec` folder, which contains a series of
JSON files taken directly from the Elasticsearch rest-api-spec.
You should copy from there the updated endpoint defintion and change it here.

### The validation in broken on GitHub but works on my machine!

Very likely the recordings on your machine are stale, rerun the validation with the `validate-no-cache` make target.

You should pull the latest change from the `client-flight-recorder` as well.

```sh
cd client-flight-recorder
git pull
```

### Where do I find the generated test?

Everytime you run the `run-validations` script, a series of test will be generated and dumped on disk.
You can find them in `clients-flight-recorder/scripts/types-validator/workbench`.
The content of this folder is a series of recorded responses from Elasticsearch wrapped inside an helper
that verifies if the type definiton is correct.

### Which editor should I use?

Any editor is fine, but to have a better development experience it should be configured
to work with TypeScript. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) come with TypeScript support out of the box.

### Is there a complete example of the process?

Yes, take a look [here](./docs/validation-example.md).

### realpath: command not found

The validation script uses realpath which may be not present in your system.
If you are using MacOS, run the following command to fix the issue:

```sh
brew install coreutils
```

### The `recordings` folder contains a zip file and not the `tmp-*` folders

Very likely your system does not have the `zip` command installed.
```sh
# on mac
brew install zip

# on linux
apt-get install -y zip
```

Then remove the content of `recordings-dev/elasticsearch/*` and run `PULL_LATEST=true ./run-validations.sh` again.

### I need to modify che compiler, help!

Take a look at the [compiler documentation](./docs/compiler.md).
