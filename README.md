# Elasticsearch API Specification

The **Elasticsearch API Specification** provides the contract for communication between client and server components within the Elasticsearch stack.
With almost 500 API endpoints and around 3000 data types across the entire API surface, this project is a vitally important part of sustaining our engineering efforts at scale.

The repository has the following structure:

| Path | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| [`api-design-guidelines/`](api-design-guidelines/) | Knowledge base of best practices for API design. |
| [`compiler/`](compiler/) | TypeScript compiler for specification definition to JSON. |
| [`compiler-rs/`](compiler-rs/) | |
| [`docs/`](docs/) | |
| [`output/`](output/) | |
| [`specification/`](specification/) | Elasticsearch request/response definitions in TypeScript. |
| [`typescript-generator/`](typescript-generator/) | |

This JSON representation is formally defined by [a set of TypeScript definitions (a meta-model)](./compiler/src/model/metamodel.ts)
that also explains the various properties and their values.


## Prepare the environment

For generating the JSON representation and running the validation code you need
to install and configure Node.js in your development environment.

You can install Node.js with [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

Once the installation is completed, install Node.js with `nvm`:

```sh
# this command will install the version configured in .nvmrc
nvm install
```

## How to generate the JSON representation

```
# clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification.git

# install the dependencies
$ make setup

# generate the JSON representation
$ make generate

# the generated output can be found in ./output/schema/schema.json
$ cat output/schema/schema.json
```

### Structure of the JSON representation

The JSON representation is [formally defined as TypeScript definitions](./compiler/src/model/metamodel.ts).
Refer to them for the full details. It is an object with two top level keys:

```jsonc
{
  "types": [...],
  "endpoints": [...]
}
```

The first one, `types`, contains all the type definitions from the specification, such as
`IndexRequest` or `MainError`, while the second one, `endpoints`, contains every
endpoint of Elasticsearch and the respective type mapping. For example:

```jsonc
{
  "types": [    {
    "attachedBehaviors": [
      "CommonQueryParameters"
    ],
    "body": {
      "kind": "value",
      "value": {
        "kind": "instance_of",
        "type": {
          "name": "TDocument",
          "namespace": "_global.index"
        }
      }
    },
    "generics": [
      {
        "name": "TDocument",
        "namespace": "_global.index"
      }
    ],
    "inherits": {
      "type": {
        "name": "RequestBase",
        "namespace": "_types"
      }
    },
    "kind": "request",
    "name": {
      "name": "Request",
      "namespace": "_global.index"
    },
    "path": [...],
    "query": [...]
  }, {
    "inherits": {
      "type": {
        "name": "WriteResponseBase",
        "namespace": "_types"
      }
    },
    "kind": "response",
    "name": {
      "name": "Response",
      "namespace": "_global.index"
    }
  }],
  "endpoints": [{
      "accept": [
        "application/json"
      ],
      "contentType": [
        "application/json"
      ],
      "description": "Creates or updates a document in an index.",
      "docUrl": "https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/docs-index_.html",
      "name": "index",
      "request": {
        "name": "Request",
        "namespace": "_global.index"
      },
      "requestBodyRequired": true,
      "response": {
        "name": "Response",
        "namespace": "_global.index"
      },
      "since": "0.0.0",
      "stability": "stable",
      "urls": [...],
      "visibility": "public"
    }]
}
```

The example above represents the [index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-index_.html)
request, inside the `endpoints` array you can find the API name and the type mappings under `request.name`
and `response.name`. The respective type definitons can be found inside the `types` array.

In some cases an endpoint might be defined, but there is no a type definition yet, in such case
the `request` and `response` value will be `null`.

## How to validate the specification

The specification is validated daily by the [client-flight-recorder](https://github.com/elastic/clients-flight-recorder) project.
The validation result can be found [here](https://github.com/elastic/clients-flight-recorder/blob/main/recordings/types-validation/types-validation.md).

### Validate the specification in your machine

The following step only apply if you don't have `~/.elastic/github.token` in place.

Create GitHub token to allow authentication with [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
  * Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens.
  * Click `Generate new token`.
  * Give your token a name and make sure to click the `repo` and `read:org` scopes.
  * Create a file at `~/.elastic/github.token` and paste the GitHub token into it.
  * Change permissions on the file allow access only from the user.
     `chmod 600 ~/.elastic/github.token`

You can see [here](https://github.com/elastic/infra/tree/master/docs/vault#github-auth)
how to generate a token.

Once you have configured the environment, run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-specification.git
git clone https://github.com/elastic/clients-flight-recorder.git

cd elasticsearch-specification
# this will validate the xpack.info request type against the main branch of Elasticsearch
make validate api=xpack.info type=request branch=main

# this will validate the xpack.info request and response types against the 8.15 branch
make validate api=xpack.info branch=8.15
```

The last command above will install all the dependencies and run, download
the test recordings and finally validate the specification.
If you need to download the recordings again, run `make validate-no-cache api=xpack.info type=request branch=main`.

Once you see the errors, you can fix the original definition in `/specification`
and then run the command again until the types validator does not trigger any new error.
Finally open a pull request with your changes.

## FAQ

### I want to see a report of how types and namespaces are being used.

You can find a report of the `main` branch [here](https://elastic.github.io/elasticsearch-specification/report.html).

### A specific property is not always present, how do I define it?

When you define a property the syntax is `propertyName: propertyType`.
By default a property is required to exist. If you know that a property will not
always be there, you can add a question mark just before the column:

```ts
propertyRequired: string
propertyOptional?: string
```

### A definition is missing, how do I add it?

See [here](./docs/add-new-api.md).

### A definition is not correct, how do I fix it?

All the definitons are inside `/specification` folder, search the bad defintion and update it,
you can find above how to run the validation of the spec.

### An endpoint is missing, how do I add it?

See [here](./docs/add-new-api.md).

### An endpoint definition is not correct, how do I fix it?

All the endpoint definitons are inside `/specification/_json_spec` folder, which contains a series of
JSON files taken directly from the Elasticsearch rest-api-spec.
You should copy from there the updated endpoint defintion and change it here.

### The validation in broken on GitHub but works on my machine!

Very likely the recordings on your machine are stale, rerun the validation with the `validate-no-cache` make target.

You should pull the latest change from the `client-flight-recorder` as well.

```sh
cd client-flight-recorder
git pull
```

### Where do I find the generated test?

Everytime you run `make validate` script, a series of test will be generated and dumped on disk.
You can find the failed tests in `clients-flight-recorder/scripts/types-validator/workbench`.
The content of this folder is a series of recorded responses from Elasticsearch wrapped inside an helper
that verifies if the type definiton is correct.

### Which editor should I use?

Any editor is fine, but to have a better development experience it should be configured
to work with TypeScript. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) come with TypeScript support out of the box.

### Is there a complete example of the process?

Yes, take a look [here](./docs/validation-example.md).

### realpath: command not found

The validation script uses realpath which may be not present in your system.
If you are using MacOS, run the following command to fix the issue:

```sh
brew install coreutils
```

### I need to modify che compiler, help!

Take a look at the [compiler documentation](./docs/compiler.md).
