          apiKeyAuth:

            type: apiKey
            description: |
              Elasticsearch APIs support key-based authentication.
              You must create an API key and use the encoded value in the request header.
              For example:

              
              ```
              curl -X GET "${ES_URL}/_cat/indices?v=true" \
                -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}"
              ```
              
              To get API keys, use the `/_security/api_key` APIs.
          basicAuth:
            scheme: basic
            type: http
          bearerAuth:
            scheme: bearer
            type: http
            description: |
              Elasticsearch APIs support the use of bearer tokens in the `Authorization` HTTP header to authenticate with the API.
              For examples, refer to [Token-based authentication services](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/token-authentication-services.html)
