            Elasticsearch APIs use key-based authentication.
            You must create an API key and use the encoded value in the request header.
            For example:
            
            
            ```
            curl -X GET "${ES_URL}/_cat/indices?v=true" \
              -H "Authorization: ApiKey ${API_KEY}"
            ```
            
            For more information about where to find API keys for the Elasticsearch endpoint (${ES_URL}) for a project, go to [Get started with Elasticsearch Serverless](https://www.elastic.co/docs/solutions/search/serverless-elasticsearch-get-started).
