          description: >
            The compact and aligned text (CAT) APIs aim are intended only for human consumption using the Kibana console or command line.
            They are not intended for use by applications.
            For application consumption, it's recommend to use a corresponding JSON API.
            
            All the cat commands accept a query string parameter `help` to see all the headers and info they provide, and the `/_cat` command alone lists all the available commands.

          x-displayName: Connector
          description: >
            The connector and sync jobs APIs provide a convenient way to create and manage Elastic connectors and sync jobs in an internal index.
            
            Connectors are Elasticsearch integrations that bring content from third-party data sources, which can be deployed on Elastic Cloud or hosted on your own infrastructure:
            
            * Native connectors are a managed service on Elastic Cloud
            * Connector clients are self-managed on your infrastructure
            
            This API provides an alternative to relying solely on Kibana UI for connector and sync job management. The API comes with a set of validations and assertions to ensure that the state representation in the internal index remains valid.

          x-displayName: Inference
          description: >
            Inference APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in machine learning models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Azure, Google AI Studio or Hugging Face.
            For built-in models and models uploaded through Eland, the inference APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage trained models.
            However, if you do not plan to use the inference APIs to use these models or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the machine learning trained model APIs.

          description: >
            Query rules enable you to configure per-query rules that are applied at query time to queries that match the specific rule.
            Query rules are organized into rulesets, collections of query rules that are matched against incoming queries.
            Query rules are applied using the rule query.
            
            If a query matches one or more rules in the ruleset, the query is re-written to apply the rules before searching.
            This allows pinning documents for only queries that match a specific term.
