            The compact and aligned text (CAT) APIs aim are intended only for human consumption using the Kibana console or command line.
            They are not intended for use by applications.
            For application consumption, it's recommend to use a corresponding JSON API.
            
            All the cat commands accept a query string parameter `help` to see all the headers and info they provide, and the `/_cat` command alone lists all the available commands.

          description: >
            The connector and sync jobs APIs provide a convenient way to create and manage Elastic connectors and sync jobs in an internal index.
            
            Connectors are Elasticsearch integrations that bring content from third-party data sources, which can be deployed on Elastic Cloud or hosted on your own infrastructure:
            
            * Native connectors are a managed service on Elastic Cloud
            * Connector clients are self-managed on your infrastructure
            
            This API provides an alternative to relying solely on Kibana UI for connector and sync job management. The API comes with a set of validations and assertions to ensure that the state representation in the internal index remains valid.

            However, if you do not plan to use the inference APIs to use these models or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the machine learning trained model APIs.

            Query rules are organized into rulesets, collections of query rules that are matched against incoming queries.
            Query rules are applied using the rule query.
            
            If a query matches one or more rules in the ruleset, the query is re-written to apply the rules before searching.
            This allows pinning documents for only queries that match a specific term.

          The name or definition of the tokenizer to use after character filters are applied.
          This property is compulsory if `categorization_analyzer` is specified as an object.
          Machine learning provides a tokenizer called `ml_standard` that tokenizes in a way that has been determined to produce good categorization results on a variety of log file formats for logs in English.
          If you want to use that tokenizer but change the character or token filters, specify `"tokenizer": "ml_standard"` in your `categorization_analyzer`.
          Additionally, the `ml_classic` tokenizer is available, which tokenizes in the same way as the non-customizable tokenizer in old versions of the product (before 6.2).
          `ml_classic` was the default categorization tokenizer in versions 6.2 to 7.13, so if you need categorization identical to the default for jobs created in these versions, specify `"tokenizer": "ml_classic"` in your `categorization_analyzer`.
