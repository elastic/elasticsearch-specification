/**
 * Get all tasks.
 * Get information about the tasks currently running on one or more nodes in the cluster.
 *
 * WARNING: The task management API is new and should still be considered a beta feature.
 * The API may change in ways that are not backwards compatible.
 *
 * **Identifying running tasks**
 *
 * The `X-Opaque-Id header`, when provided on the HTTP request header, is going to be returned as a header in the response as well as in the headers field for in the task information.
 * This enables you to track certain calls or associate certain tasks with the client that started them.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * curl -i -H "X-Opaque-Id: 123456" "http://localhost:9200/_tasks?group_by=parents"
 * ```
 *
 * The API returns the following result:
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * X-Opaque-Id: 123456
 * content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
 * content-length: 831
 *
 * {
 *   "tasks" : {
 *     "u5lcZHqcQhu-rUoFaqDphA:45" : {
 *       "node" : "u5lcZHqcQhu-rUoFaqDphA",
 *       "id" : 45,
 *       "type" : "transport",
 *       "action" : "cluster:monitor/tasks/lists",
 *       "start_time_in_millis" : 1513823752749,
 *       "running_time_in_nanos" : 293139,
 *       "cancellable" : false,
 *       "headers" : {
 *         "X-Opaque-Id" : "123456"
 *       },
 *       "children" : [
 *         {
 *           "node" : "u5lcZHqcQhu-rUoFaqDphA",
 *           "id" : 46,
 *           "type" : "direct",
 *           "action" : "cluster:monitor/tasks/lists[n]",
 *           "start_time_in_millis" : 1513823752750,
 *           "running_time_in_nanos" : 92133,
 *           "cancellable" : false,
 *           "parent_task_id" : "u5lcZHqcQhu-rUoFaqDphA:45",
 *           "headers" : {
 *             "X-Opaque-Id" : "123456"
 *           }
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   }
 *  }
 * ```
 * In this example, `X-Opaque-Id: 123456` is the ID as a part of the response header.
 * The `X-Opaque-Id` in the task `headers` is the ID for the task that was initiated by the REST request.
 * The `X-Opaque-Id` in the children `headers` is the child task of the task that was initiated by the REST request.
