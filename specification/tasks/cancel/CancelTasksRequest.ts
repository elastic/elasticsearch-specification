/**
 * Cancel a task.
 *
 * WARNING: The task management API is new and should still be considered a beta feature.
 * The API may change in ways that are not backwards compatible.
 *
 * A task may continue to run for some time after it has been cancelled because it may not be able to safely stop its current activity straight away.
 * It is also possible that Elasticsearch must complete its work on other tasks before it can process the cancellation.
 * The get task information API will continue to list these cancelled tasks until they complete.
 * The cancelled flag in the response indicates that the cancellation command has been processed and the task will stop as soon as possible.
 *
 * To troubleshoot why a cancelled task does not complete promptly, use the get task information API with the `?detailed` parameter to identify the other tasks the system is running.
 * You can also use the node hot threads API to obtain detailed information about the work the system is doing instead of completing the cancelled task.
 * @rest_spec_name tasks.cancel
