/**
 * Retrieves anomaly records for an anomaly detection job.
 * Records contain the detailed analytical results. They describe the anomalous
 * activity that has been identified in the input data based on the detector
 * configuration.
 * There can be many anomaly records depending on the characteristics and size
 * of the input data. In practice, there are often too many to be able to
 * manually process them. The machine learning features therefore perform a
 * sophisticated aggregation of the anomaly records into buckets.
 * The number of record results depends on the number of anomalies found in each
 * bucket, which relates to the number of time series being modeled and the
 * number of detectors.
