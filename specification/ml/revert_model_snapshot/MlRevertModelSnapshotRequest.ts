/**
 * Revert to a snapshot.
 * The machine learning features react quickly to anomalous input, learning new
 * behaviors in data. Highly anomalous input increases the variance in the
 * models whilst the system learns whether this is a new step-change in behavior
 * or a one-off event. In the case where this anomalous input is known to be a
 * one-off, then it might be appropriate to reset the model state to a time
 * before this event. For example, you might consider reverting to a saved
 * snapshot after Black Friday or a critical system failure.
