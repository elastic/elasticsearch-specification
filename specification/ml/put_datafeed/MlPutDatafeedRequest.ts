/**
 * Instantiates a datafeed.
 * Datafeeds retrieve data from Elasticsearch for analysis by an anomaly detection job.
 * You can associate only one datafeed with each anomaly detection job.
 * The datafeed contains a query that runs at a defined interval (`frequency`).
 * If you are concerned about delayed data, you can add a delay (`query_delay') at each interval.
 * When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, your datafeed remembers which roles the user who created it had
 * at the time of creation and runs the query using those same roles. If you provide secondary authorization headers,
 * those credentials are used instead.
 * You must use Kibana, this API, or the create anomaly detection jobs API to create a datafeed. Do not add a datafeed
 * directly to the `.ml-config` index. Do not give users `write` privileges on the `.ml-config` index.
