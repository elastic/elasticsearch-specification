/**
 * Force buffered data to be processed.

 * additionally calculate new results. Both flush and close operations are
 * similar, however the flush is more efficient if you are expecting to send
 * more data for analysis. When flushing, the job remains open and is available
 * to continue analyzing data. A close operation additionally prunes and
 * persists the model state to disk and the job must be opened again before
 * analyzing further data.
