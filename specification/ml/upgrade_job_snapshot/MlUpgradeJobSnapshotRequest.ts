 * Upgrade a snapshot.
 * Upgrades an anomaly detection model snapshot to the latest major version.
 * Over time, older snapshot formats are deprecated and removed. Anomaly
 * detection jobs support only snapshots that are from the current or previous

 * This API provides a means to upgrade a snapshot to the current major version.
 * This aids in preparing the cluster for an upgrade to the next major version.
 * Only one snapshot per anomaly detection job can be upgraded at a time and the
 * upgraded snapshot cannot be the current snapshot of the anomaly detection
 * job.
