/**
 * Start a data frame analytics job.
 * A data frame analytics job can be started and stopped multiple times
 * throughout its lifecycle.
 * If the destination index does not exist, it is created automatically the
 * first time you start the data frame analytics job. The
 * `index.number_of_shards` and `index.number_of_replicas` settings for the
 * destination index are copied from the source index. If there are multiple
 * source indices, the destination index copies the highest setting values. The
 * mappings for the destination index are also copied from the source indices.
 * If there are any mapping conflicts, the job fails to start.
 * If the destination index exists, it is used as is. You can therefore set up
 * the destination index in advance with custom settings and mappings.
