/**
 * Get overall bucket results.
 *
 * Retrievs overall bucket results that summarize the bucket results of
 * multiple anomaly detection jobs.
 *
 * The `overall_score` is calculated by combining the scores of all the
 * buckets within the overall bucket span. First, the maximum
 * `anomaly_score` per anomaly detection job in the overall bucket is
 * calculated. Then the `top_n` of those scores are averaged to result in
 * the `overall_score`. This means that you can fine-tune the
 * `overall_score` so that it is more or less sensitive to the number of
 * jobs that detect an anomaly at the same time. For example, if you set
 * `top_n` to `1`, the `overall_score` is the maximum bucket score in the
 * overall bucket. Alternatively, if you set `top_n` to the number of jobs,
 * the `overall_score` is high only when all jobs detect anomalies in that
 * overall bucket. If you set the `bucket_span` parameter (to a value
 * greater than its default), the `overall_score` is the maximum
 * `overall_score` of the overall buckets that have a span equal to the
 * jobs' largest bucket span.
