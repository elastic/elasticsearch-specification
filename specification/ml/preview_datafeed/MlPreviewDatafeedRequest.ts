/**
 * Previews a datafeed.
 * This API returns the first "page" of search results from a datafeed.
 * You can preview an existing datafeed or provide configuration details for a datafeed
 * and anomaly detection job in the API. The preview shows the structure of the data
 * that will be passed to the anomaly detection engine.
 * IMPORTANT: When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, the preview uses the credentials of the user that
 * called the API. However, when the datafeed starts it uses the roles of the last user that created or updated the
 * datafeed. To get a preview that accurately reflects the behavior of the datafeed, use the appropriate credentials.
 * You can also use secondary authorization headers to supply the credentials.
