/**
 * Sets a cluster wide upgrade_mode setting that prepares machine learning
 * indices for an upgrade.
 * When upgrading your cluster, in some circumstances you must restart your
 * nodes and reindex your machine learning indices. In those circumstances,
 * there must be no machine learning jobs running. You can close the machine
 * learning jobs, do the upgrade, then open all the jobs again. Alternatively,
 * you can use this API to temporarily halt tasks associated with the jobs and
 * datafeeds and prevent new jobs from opening. You can also use this API
 * during upgrades that do not require you to reindex your machine learning
 * indices, though stopping jobs is not a requirement in that case.
 * You can see the current value for the upgrade_mode setting by using the get
 * machine learning info API.
