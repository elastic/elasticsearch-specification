     * numeric or boolean are ignored. Documents where included fields contain
     * missing values, null values, or an array are also ignored. Therefore the

     * Regression supports fields that are numeric, `boolean`, `text`,
     * `keyword`, and `ip` data types. It is also tolerant of missing values.
     * Fields that are supported are included in the analysis, other fields are
     * ignored. Documents where included fields contain an array with two or
     * more values are also ignored. Documents in the `dest` index that don’t
     * contain a results field are not included in the regression analysis.
     * Classification supports fields that are numeric, `boolean`, `text`,
     * `keyword`, and `ip` data types. It is also tolerant of missing values.
     * Fields that are supported are included in the analysis, other fields are
     * ignored. Documents where included fields contain an array with two or
     * more values are also ignored. Documents in the `dest` index that don’t
     * contain a results field are not included in the classification analysis.
