/**
 * Create or update a trained model alias.
 * A trained model alias is a logical name used to reference a single trained
 * model.
 * You can use aliases instead of trained model identifiers to make it easier to
 * reference your models. For example, you can use aliases in inference
 * aggregations and processors.
 * An alias must be unique and refer to only a single trained model. However,
 * you can have multiple aliases for each trained model.
 * If you use this API to update an alias such that it references a different
 * trained model ID and the model uses a different type of data frame analytics,
 * an error occurs. For example, this situation occurs if you have a trained
 * model for regression analysis and a trained model for classification
 * analysis; you cannot reassign an alias from one type of trained model to
 * another.
 * If you use this API to update an alias and there are very few input fields in
 * common between the old and new trained models for the model alias, the API
 * returns a warning.
