summary: Sequence query
# method_request: GET /my-data-stream/_eql/search
description: >
  Run `GET /my-data-stream/_eql/search` to search for a sequence of events.
  The sequence starts with an event with an `event.category` of `file`, a `file.name` of `cmd.exe`, and a `process.pid` other than `2013`.
  It is followed by an event with an `event.category` of `process` and a `process.executable` that contains the substring `regsvr32`.
  These events must also share the same `process.pid` value.
