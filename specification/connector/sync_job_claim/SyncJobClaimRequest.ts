/**
 * Claim a connector sync job.
 * This action updates the job status to `in_progress` and sets the `last_seen` and `started_at` timestamps to the current time.
 * Additionally, it can set the `sync_cursor` property for the sync job.
 *
 * This API is not intended for direct connector management by users.
 * It supports the implementation of services that utilize the connector protocol to communicate with Elasticsearch.
 *
 * To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the Elastic connector service on your own infrastructure.
 * This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.
