/**
 * Update the connector features.
 * Update the connector features in the connector document.
 * This API can be used to control the following aspects of a connector:
 *
 * * document-level security
 * * incremental syncs
 * * advanced sync rules
 * * basic sync rules
 *
 * Normally, the running connector service automatically manages these features.
 * However, you can use this API to override the default behavior.
 *
 * To sync data using self-managed connectors, you need to deploy the Elastic connector service on your own infrastructure.
 * This service runs automatically on Elastic Cloud for Elastic managed connectors.
