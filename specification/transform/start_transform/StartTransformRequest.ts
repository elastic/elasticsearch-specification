/**
 * Start a transform.
 * Starts a transform.
 *
 * When you start a transform, it creates the destination index if it does not already exist. The `number_of_shards` is
 * set to `1` and the `auto_expand_replicas` is set to `0-1`. If it is a pivot transform, it deduces the mapping
 * definitions for the destination index from the source indices and the transform aggregations. If fields in the
 * destination index are derived from scripts (as in the case of `scripted_metric` or `bucket_script` aggregations),
 * the transform uses dynamic mappings unless an index template exists. If it is a latest transform, it does not deduce
 * mapping definitions; it uses dynamic mappings. To use explicit mappings, create the destination index before you
 * start the transform. Alternatively, you can create an index template, though it does not affect the deduced mappings
 * in a pivot transform.
 *
 * When the transform starts, a series of validations occur to ensure its success. If you deferred validation when you
 * created the transform, they occur when you start the transform—​with the exception of privilege checks. When
 * Elasticsearch security features are enabled, the transform remembers which roles the user that created it had at the
 * time of creation and uses those same roles. If those roles do not have the required privileges on the source and
 * destination indices, the transform fails when it attempts unauthorized operations.
