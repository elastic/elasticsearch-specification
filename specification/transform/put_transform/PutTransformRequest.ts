/**
 * Create a transform.
 * Creates a transform.
 *
 * A transform copies data from source indices, transforms it, and persists it into an entity-centric destination index. You can also think of the destination index as a two-dimensional tabular data structure (known as
 * a data frame). The ID for each document in the data frame is generated from a hash of the entity, so there is a
 * unique row per entity.
 *
 * You must choose either the latest or pivot method for your transform; you cannot use both in a single transform. If
 * you choose to use the pivot method for your transform, the entities are defined by the set of `group_by` fields in
 * the pivot object. If you choose to use the latest method, the entities are defined by the `unique_key` field values
 * in the latest object.
 *
 * You must have `create_index`, `index`, and `read` privileges on the destination index and `read` and
 * `view_index_metadata` privileges on the source indices. When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, the
 * transform remembers which roles the user that created it had at the time of creation and uses those same roles. If
 * those roles do not have the required privileges on the source and destination indices, the transform fails when it
 * attempts unauthorized operations.
 *
 * NOTE: You must use Kibana or this API to create a transform. Do not add a transform directly into any
 * `.transform-internal*` indices using the Elasticsearch index API. If Elasticsearch security features are enabled, do
 * not give users any privileges on `.transform-internal*` indices. If you used transforms prior to 7.5, also do not
 * give users any privileges on `.data-frame-internal*` indices.
