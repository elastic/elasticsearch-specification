/**
 * Set upgrade_mode for transform indices.
 * Sets a cluster wide upgrade_mode setting that prepares transform
 * indices for an upgrade.
 * When upgrading your cluster, in some circumstances you must restart your
 * nodes and reindex your transform indices. In those circumstances,
 * there must be no transforms running. You can close the transforms,
 * do the upgrade, then open all the transforms again. Alternatively,
 * you can use this API to temporarily halt tasks associated with the transforms
 * and prevent new transforms from opening. You can also use this API
 * during upgrades that do not require you to reindex your transform
 * indices, though stopping transforms is not a requirement in that case.
 * You can see the current value for the upgrade_mode setting by using the get
 * transform info API.
