/**
 * Create or update an index template.
 * Index templates define settings, mappings, and aliases that can be applied automatically to new indices.
 *
 * Elasticsearch applies templates to new indices based on an wildcard pattern that matches the index name.
 * Index templates are applied during data stream or index creation.
 * For data streams, these settings and mappings are applied when the stream's backing indices are created.
 * Settings and mappings specified in a create index API request override any settings or mappings specified in an index template.
 * Changes to index templates do not affect existing indices, including the existing backing indices of a data stream.
 *
 * You can use C-style `/* *\/` block comments in index templates.
 * You can include comments anywhere in the request body, except before the opening curly bracket.
 *
 * **Multiple matching templates**
 *
 * If multiple index templates match the name of a new index or data stream, the template with the highest priority is used.
 *
 * Multiple templates with overlapping index patterns at the same priority are not allowed and an error will be thrown when attempting to create a template matching an existing index template at identical priorities.
 *
 * **Composing aliases, mappings, and settings**
 *
 * When multiple component templates are specified in the `composed_of` field for an index template, they are merged in the order specified, meaning that later component templates override earlier component templates.
 * Any mappings, settings, or aliases from the parent index template are merged in next.
 * Finally, any configuration on the index request itself is merged.
 * Mapping definitions are merged recursively, which means that later mapping components can introduce new field mappings and update the mapping configuration.
 * If a field mapping is already contained in an earlier component, its definition will be completely overwritten by the later one.
 * This recursive merging strategy applies not only to field mappings, but also root options like `dynamic_templates` and `meta`.
 * If an earlier component contains a `dynamic_templates` block, then by default new `dynamic_templates` entries are appended onto the end.
 * If an entry already exists with the same key, then it is overwritten by the new definition.
