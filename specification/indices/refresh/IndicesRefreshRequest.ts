/**
 * Refresh an index.
 * A refresh makes recent operations performed on one or more indices available for search.
 * For data streams, the API runs the refresh operation on the streamâ€™s backing indices.
 *
 * By default, Elasticsearch periodically refreshes indices every second, but only on indices that have received one search request or more in the last 30 seconds.
 * You can change this default interval with the `index.refresh_interval` setting.
 *
 * Refresh requests are synchronous and do not return a response until the refresh operation completes.
 *
 * Refreshes are resource-intensive.
 * To ensure good cluster performance, it's recommended to wait for Elasticsearch's periodic refresh rather than performing an explicit refresh when possible.
 *
 * If your application workflow indexes documents and then runs a search to retrieve the indexed document, it's recommended to use the index API's `refresh=wait_for` query parameter option.
 * This option ensures the indexing operation waits for a periodic refresh before running the search.
