/**
 * Shrink an index.
 * Shrink an index into a new index with fewer primary shards.
 *
 * Before you can shrink an index:
 *
 * * The index must be read-only.
 * * A copy of every shard in the index must reside on the same node.
 * * The index must have a green health status.
 *
 * To make shard allocation easier, we recommend you also remove the index's replica shards.
 * You can later re-add replica shards as part of the shrink operation.
 *
 * The requested number of primary shards in the target index must be a factor of the number of shards in the source index.
 * For example an index with 8 primary shards can be shrunk into 4, 2 or 1 primary shards or an index with 15 primary shards can be shrunk into 5, 3 or 1.
 * If the number of shards in the index is a prime number it can only be shrunk into a single primary shard
 *  Before shrinking, a (primary or replica) copy of every shard in the index must be present on the same node.
 *
 * The current write index on a data stream cannot be shrunk. In order to shrink the current write index, the data stream must first be rolled over so that a new write index is created and then the previous write index can be shrunk.
 *
 * A shrink operation:
 *
 * * Creates a new target index with the same definition as the source index, but with a smaller number of primary shards.
 * * Hard-links segments from the source index into the target index. If the file system does not support hard-linking, then all segments are copied into the new index, which is a much more time consuming process. Also if using multiple data paths, shards on different data paths require a full copy of segment files if they are not on the same disk since hardlinks do not work across disks.
 * * Recovers the target index as though it were a closed index which had just been re-opened. Recovers shards to the `.routing.allocation.initial_recovery._id` index setting.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Indices can only be shrunk if they satisfy the following requirements:
 *
 * * The target index must not exist.
 * * The source index must have more primary shards than the target index.
 * * The number of primary shards in the target index must be a factor of the number of primary shards in the source index. The source index must have more primary shards than the target index.
 * * The index must not contain more than 2,147,483,519 documents in total across all shards that will be shrunk into a single shard on the target index as this is the maximum number of docs that can fit into a single shard.
 * * The node handling the shrink process must have sufficient free disk space to accommodate a second copy of the existing index.
