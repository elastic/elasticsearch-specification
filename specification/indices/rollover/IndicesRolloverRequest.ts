/**
 * Roll over to a new index.
 * TIP: It is recommended to use the index lifecycle rollover action to automate rollovers.
 *
 * The rollover API creates a new index for a data stream or index alias.
 * The API behavior depends on the rollover target.
 *
 * **Roll over a data stream**
 *
 * If you roll over a data stream, the API creates a new write index for the stream.
 * The stream's previous write index becomes a regular backing index.
 * A rollover also increments the data stream's generation.
 *
 * **Roll over an index alias with a write index**
 *
 * TIP: Prior to Elasticsearch 7.9, you'd typically use an index alias with a write index to manage time series data.
 * Data streams replace this functionality, require less maintenance, and automatically integrate with data tiers.
 *
 * If an index alias points to multiple indices, one of the indices must be a write index.
 * The rollover API creates a new write index for the alias with `is_write_index` set to `true`.
 * The API also `sets is_write_index` to `false` for the previous write index.
 *
 * **Roll over an index alias with one index**
 *
 * If you roll over an index alias that points to only one index, the API creates a new index for the alias and removes the original index from the alias.
 *
 * NOTE: A rollover creates a new index and is subject to the `wait_for_active_shards` setting.
 *
 * **Increment index names for an alias**
 *
 * When you roll over an index alias, you can specify a name for the new index.
 * If you don't specify a name and the current index ends with `-` and a number, such as `my-index-000001` or `my-index-3`, the new index name increments that number.
 * For example, if you roll over an alias with a current index of `my-index-000001`, the rollover creates a new index named `my-index-000002`.
 * This number is always six characters and zero-padded, regardless of the previous index's name.
 *
 * If you use an index alias for time series data, you can use date math in the index name to track the rollover date.
 * For example, you can create an alias that points to an index named `<my-index-{now/d}-000001>`.
 * If you create the index on May 6, 2099, the index's name is `my-index-2099.05.06-000001`.
 * If you roll over the alias on May 7, 2099, the new index's name is `my-index-2099.05.07-000002`.
