/**
 * Update index settings.
 * Changes dynamic index settings in real time.
 * For data streams, index setting changes are applied to all backing indices by default.
 *
 * To revert a setting to the default value, use a null value.
 * The list of per-index settings that can be updated dynamically on live indices can be found in index module documentation.
 * To preserve existing settings from being updated, set the `preserve_existing` parameter to `true`.
 *
 * NOTE: You can only define new analyzers on closed indices.
 * To add an analyzer, you must close the index, define the analyzer, and reopen the index.
 * You cannot close the write index of a data stream.
 * To update the analyzer for a data stream's write index and future backing indices, update the analyzer in the index template used by the stream.
 * Then roll over the data stream to apply the new analyzer to the stream's write index and future backing indices.
 * This affects searches and any new data added to the stream after the rollover.
 * However, it does not affect the data stream's backing indices or their existing data.
 * To change the analyzer for existing backing indices, you must create a new data stream and reindex your data into it.
