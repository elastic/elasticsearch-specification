/**
 * Create or update an index template.
 * Index templates define settings, mappings, and aliases that can be applied automatically to new indices.
 * Elasticsearch applies templates to new indices based on an index pattern that matches the index name.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This documentation is about legacy index templates, which are deprecated and will be replaced by the composable templates introduced in Elasticsearch 7.8.
 *
 * Composable templates always take precedence over legacy templates.
 * If no composable template matches a new index, matching legacy templates are applied according to their order.
 *
 * Index templates are only applied during index creation.
 * Changes to index templates do not affect existing indices.
 * Settings and mappings specified in create index API requests override any settings or mappings specified in an index template.
 *
 * You can use C-style `/* *\/` block comments in index templates.
 * You can include comments anywhere in the request body, except before the opening curly bracket.
 *
 * **Indices matching multiple templates**
 *
 * Multiple index templates can potentially match an index, in this case, both the settings and mappings are merged into the final configuration of the index.
 * The order of the merging can be controlled using the order parameter, with lower order being applied first, and higher orders overriding them.
 * NOTE: Multiple matching templates with the same order value will result in a non-deterministic merging order.
