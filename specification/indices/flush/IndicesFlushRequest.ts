/**
 * Flush data streams or indices.
 * Flushing a data stream or index is the process of making sure that any data that is currently only stored in the transaction log is also permanently stored in the Lucene index.
 * When restarting, Elasticsearch replays any unflushed operations from the transaction log into the Lucene index to bring it back into the state that it was in before the restart.
 * Elasticsearch automatically triggers flushes as needed, using heuristics that trade off the size of the unflushed transaction log against the cost of performing each flush.
 *
 * After each operation has been flushed it is permanently stored in the Lucene index.
 * This may mean that there is no need to maintain an additional copy of it in the transaction log.
 * The transaction log is made up of multiple files, called generations, and Elasticsearch will delete any generation files when they are no longer needed, freeing up disk space.
 *
 * It is also possible to trigger a flush on one or more indices using the flush API, although it is rare for users to need to call this API directly.
 * If you call the flush API after indexing some documents then a successful response indicates that Elasticsearch has flushed all the documents that were indexed before the flush API was called.
