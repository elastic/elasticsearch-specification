/**
 * Open a closed index.
 * For data streams, the API opens any closed backing indices.
 *
 * A closed index is blocked for read/write operations and does not allow all operations that opened indices allow.
 * It is not possible to index documents or to search for documents in a closed index.
 * This allows closed indices to not have to maintain internal data structures for indexing or searching documents, resulting in a smaller overhead on the cluster.
 *
 * When opening or closing an index, the master is responsible for restarting the index shards to reflect the new state of the index.
 * The shards will then go through the normal recovery process.
 * The data of opened or closed indices is automatically replicated by the cluster to ensure that enough shard copies are safely kept around at all times.
 *
 * You can open and close multiple indices.
 * An error is thrown if the request explicitly refers to a missing index.
 * This behavior can be turned off by using the `ignore_unavailable=true` parameter.
 *
 * By default, you must explicitly name the indices you are opening or closing.
 * To open or close indices with `_all`, `*`, or other wildcard expressions, change the `action.destructive_requires_name` setting to `false`.
 * This setting can also be changed with the cluster update settings API.
 *
 * Closed indices consume a significant amount of disk-space which can cause problems in managed environments.
 * Closing indices can be turned off with the cluster settings API by setting `cluster.indices.close.enable` to `false`.
 *
 * Because opening or closing an index allocates its shards, the `wait_for_active_shards` setting on index creation applies to the `_open` and `_close` index actions as well.
