/**
 * Analyze the index disk usage.
 * Analyze the disk usage of each field of an index or data stream.
 * This API might not support indices created in previous Elasticsearch versions.
 * The result of a small index can be inaccurate as some parts of an index might not be analyzed by the API.
 *
 * NOTE: The total size of fields of the analyzed shards of the index in the response is usually smaller than the index `store_size` value because some small metadata files are ignored and some parts of data files might not be scanned by the API.
 * Since stored fields are stored together in a compressed format, the sizes of stored fields are also estimates and can be inaccurate.
 * The stored size of the `_id` field is likely underestimated while the `_source` field is overestimated.
