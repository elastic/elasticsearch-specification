/**
 * Split an index.
 * Split an index into a new index with more primary shards.
 * * Before you can split an index:
 *
 * * The index must be read-only.
 * * The cluster health status must be green.
 *
 * The number of times the index can be split (and the number of shards that each original shard can be split into) is determined by the `index.number_of_routing_shards` setting.
 * The number of routing shards specifies the hashing space that is used internally to distribute documents across shards with consistent hashing.
 * For instance, a 5 shard index with `number_of_routing_shards` set to 30 (5 x 2 x 3) could be split by a factor of 2 or 3.
 *
 * A split operation:
 *
 * * Creates a new target index with the same definition as the source index, but with a larger number of primary shards.
 * * Hard-links segments from the source index into the target index. If the file system doesn't support hard-linking, all segments are copied into the new index, which is a much more time consuming process.
 * * Hashes all documents again, after low level files are created, to delete documents that belong to a different shard.
 * * Recovers the target index as though it were a closed index which had just been re-opened.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Indices can only be split if they satisfy the following requirements:
 *
 * * The target index must not exist.
 * * The source index must have fewer primary shards than the target index.
 * * The number of primary shards in the target index must be a multiple of the number of primary shards in the source index.
 * * The node handling the split process must have sufficient free disk space to accommodate a second copy of the existing index.
