/**
 * Reload search analyzers.
 * Reload an index's search analyzers and their resources.
 * For data streams, the API reloads search analyzers and resources for the stream's backing indices.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: After reloading the search analyzers you should clear the request cache to make sure it doesn't contain responses derived from the previous versions of the analyzer.
 *
 * You can use the reload search analyzers API to pick up changes to synonym files used in the `synonym_graph` or `synonym` token filter of a search analyzer.
 * To be eligible, the token filter must have an `updateable` flag of `true` and only be used in search analyzers.
 *
 * NOTE: This API does not perform a reload for each shard of an index.
 * Instead, it performs a reload for each node containing index shards.
 * As a result, the total shard count returned by the API can differ from the number of index shards.
 * Because reloading affects every node with an index shard, it is important to update the synonym file on every data node in the cluster--including nodes that don't contain a shard replica--before using this API.
 * This ensures the synonym file is updated everywhere in the cluster in case shards are relocated in the future.
