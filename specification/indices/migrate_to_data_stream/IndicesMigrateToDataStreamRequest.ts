/**
 * Convert an index alias to a data stream.
 * Converts an index alias to a data stream.
 * You must have a matching index template that is data stream enabled.
 * The alias must meet the following criteria:
 * The alias must have a write index;
 * All indices for the alias must have a `@timestamp` field mapping of a `date` or `date_nanos` field type;
 * The alias must not have any filters;
 * The alias must not use custom routing.
 * If successful, the request removes the alias and creates a data stream with the same name.
 * The indices for the alias become hidden backing indices for the stream.
 * The write index for the alias becomes the write index for the stream.
