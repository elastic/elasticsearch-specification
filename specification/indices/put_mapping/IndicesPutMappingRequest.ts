/**
 * Update field mappings.
 * Add new fields to an existing data stream or index.
 * You can also use this API to change the search settings of existing fields and add new properties to existing object fields.
 * For data streams, these changes are applied to all backing indices by default.
 *
 * **Add multi-fields to an existing field**
 *
 * Multi-fields let you index the same field in different ways.
 * You can use this API to update the fields mapping parameter and enable multi-fields for an existing field.
 * WARNING: If an index (or data stream) contains documents when you add a multi-field, those documents will not have values for the new multi-field.
 * You can populate the new multi-field with the update by query API.
 *
 * **Change supported mapping parameters for an existing field**
 *
 * The documentation for each mapping parameter indicates whether you can update it for an existing field using this API.
 * For example, you can use the update mapping API to update the `ignore_above` parameter.
 *
 * **Change the mapping of an existing field**
 *
 * Except for supported mapping parameters, you can't change the mapping or field type of an existing field.
 * Changing an existing field could invalidate data that's already indexed.
 *
 * If you need to change the mapping of a field in a data stream's backing indices, refer to documentation about modifying data streams.
 * If you need to change the mapping of a field in other indices, create a new index with the correct mapping and reindex your data into that index.
 *
 * **Rename a field**
 *
 * Renaming a field would invalidate data already indexed under the old field name.
 * Instead, add an alias field to create an alternate field name.
