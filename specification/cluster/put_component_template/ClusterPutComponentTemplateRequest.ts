/**
 * Create or update a component template.
 * Creates or updates a component template.
 * Component templates are building blocks for constructing index templates that specify index mappings, settings, and aliases.
 *
 * An index template can be composed of multiple component templates.
 * To use a component template, specify it in an index template’s `composed_of` list.
 * Component templates are only applied to new data streams and indices as part of a matching index template.
 *
 * Settings and mappings specified directly in the index template or the create index request override any settings or mappings specified in a component template.
 *
 * Component templates are only used during index creation.
 * For data streams, this includes data stream creation and the creation of a stream’s backing indices.
 * Changes to component templates do not affect existing indices, including a stream’s backing indices.
 *
 * You can use C-style `/* *\/` block comments in component templates.
 * You can include comments anywhere in the request body except before the opening curly bracket.
