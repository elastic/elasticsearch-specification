/**
 * Update the cluster settings.
 * Configure and update dynamic settings on a running cluster.
 * You can also configure dynamic settings locally on an unstarted or shut down node in `elasticsearch.yml`.
 *
 * Updates made with this API can be persistent, which apply across cluster restarts, or transient, which reset after a cluster restart.
 * You can also reset transient or persistent settings by assigning them a null value.
 *
 * If you configure the same setting using multiple methods, Elasticsearch applies the settings in following order of precedence: 1) Transient setting; 2) Persistent setting; 3) `elasticsearch.yml` setting; 4) Default setting value.
 * For example, you can apply a transient setting to override a persistent setting or `elasticsearch.yml` setting.
 * However, a change to an `elasticsearch.yml` setting will not override a defined transient or persistent setting.
 *
 * TIP: In Elastic Cloud, use the user settings feature to configure all cluster settings. This method automatically rejects unsafe settings that could break your cluster.
 * If you run Elasticsearch on your own hardware, use this API to configure dynamic cluster settings.
 * Only use `elasticsearch.yml` for static cluster settings and node settings.
 * The API doesn’t require a restart and ensures a setting’s value is the same on all nodes.
 *
 * WARNING: Transient cluster settings are no longer recommended. Use persistent cluster settings instead.
 * If a cluster becomes unstable, transient settings can clear unexpectedly, resulting in a potentially undesired cluster configuration.
