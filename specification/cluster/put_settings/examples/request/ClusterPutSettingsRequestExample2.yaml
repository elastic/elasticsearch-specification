summary: A setting with multiple patterns
method_request: PUT /_cluster/settings
description: >
  PUT `/_cluster/settings` to update the `action.auto_create_index` setting. The setting accepts a comma-separated list of patterns
  that you want to allow or you can prefix each pattern with `+` or `-` to indicate whether it should be allowed or blocked. In this
  example, the auto-creation of indices called `my-index-000001` or `index10` is allowed, the creation of indices that match the
  pattern `index1*` is blocked, and the creation of any other indices that match the `ind*` pattern is allowed. Patterns are matched
  in the order specified.
