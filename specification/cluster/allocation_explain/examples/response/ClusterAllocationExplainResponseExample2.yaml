summary: Maximum retries
description: >
  An example of an allocation explanation for an unassigned primary shard that has reached the maximum number of allocation retry attempts.
  After the maximum number of retries is reached, Elasticsearch stops attempting to allocate the shard in order to prevent infinite retries which may impact cluster performance.
