/**
 * Activate a user profile.
 *
 * Create or update a user profile on behalf of another user.
 *
 * NOTE: The user profile feature is designed only for use by Kibana and Elastic's Observability, Enterprise Search, and Elastic Security solutions.
 * Individual users and external applications should not call this API directly.
 * The calling application must have either an `access_token` or a combination of `username` and `password` for the user that the profile document is intended for.
 * Elastic reserves the right to change or remove this feature in future releases without prior notice.
 *
 * This API creates or updates a profile document for end users with information that is extracted from the user's authentication object including `username`, `full_name,` `roles`, and the authentication realm.
 * For example, in the JWT `access_token` case, the profile user's `username` is extracted from the JWT token claim pointed to by the `claims.principal` setting of the JWT realm that authenticated the token.
 *
 * When updating a profile document, the API enables the document if it was disabled.
 * Any updates do not change existing content for either the `labels` or `data` fields.
