/**
 * Invalidate API keys.

 * The `manage_api_key` privilege allows deleting any API keys.
 * The `manage_own_api_key` only allows deleting API keys that are owned by the user.
 * In addition, with the `manage_own_api_key` privilege, an invalidation request must be issued in one of the three formats:
 * - Set the parameter `owner=true`.
 * - Or, set both `username` and `realm_name` to match the userâ€™s identity.
 * - Or, if the request is issued by an API key, i.e. an API key invalidates itself, specify its ID in the `ids` field.
