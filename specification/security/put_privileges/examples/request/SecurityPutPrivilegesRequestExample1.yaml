summary: Add a privilege
# method_request: PUT /_security/privilege
description: >
  Run `PUT /_security/privilege` to add a single application privilege.
  The wildcard (`*`) means that this privilege grants access to all actions that start with `data:read/`.
  Elasticsearch does not assign any meaning to these actions. However,
  if the request includes an application privilege such as `data:read/users` or `data:read/settings`, the has privileges API respects the use of a wildcard and returns `true`.
