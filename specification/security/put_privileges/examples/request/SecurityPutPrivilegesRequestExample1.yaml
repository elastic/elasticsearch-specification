summary: Add a privilege
method_request: PUT /_security/privilege
description: >
  Run `PUT /_security/privilege` to add a single application privilege. The wildcard (`*`) means that this privilege grants access
  to all actions that start with `data:read/`. Elasticsearch does not assign any meaning to these actions. However, if the request
  includes an application privilege such as `data:read/users` or `data:read/settings`, the has privileges API respects the use of a
  wildcard and returns `true`.
