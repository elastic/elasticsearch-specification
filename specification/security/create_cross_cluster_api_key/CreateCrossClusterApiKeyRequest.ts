/**
 * Create a cross-cluster API key.
 *
 * Create an API key of the `cross_cluster` type for the API key based remote cluster access.
 * A `cross_cluster` API key cannot be used to authenticate through the REST interface.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: To authenticate this request you must use a credential that is not an API key. Even if you use an API key that has the required privilege, the API returns an error.
 *
 * Cross-cluster API keys are created by the Elasticsearch API key service, which is automatically enabled.
 *
 * NOTE: Unlike REST API keys, a cross-cluster API key does not capture permissions of the authenticated user. The API keyâ€™s effective permission is exactly as specified with the `access` property.
 *
 * A successful request returns a JSON structure that contains the API key, its unique ID, and its name. If applicable, it also returns expiration information for the API key in milliseconds.
 *
 * By default, API keys never expire. You can specify expiration information when you create the API keys.
 *
 * Cross-cluster API keys can only be updated with the update cross-cluster API key API.
 * Attempting to update them with the update REST API key API or the bulk update REST API keys API will result in an error.
