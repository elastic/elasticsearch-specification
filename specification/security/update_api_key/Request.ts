/**
 * Update an API key.
 *
 * Update attributes of an existing API key.
 * This API supports updates to an API key's access scope, expiration, and metadata.
 *
 * To use this API, you must have at least the `manage_own_api_key` cluster privilege.
 * Users can only update API keys that they created or that were granted to them.
 * To update another user’s API key, use the `run_as` feature to submit a request on behalf of another user.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: It's not possible to use an API key as the authentication credential for this API. The owner user’s credentials are required.
 *
 * Use this API to update API keys created by the create API key or grant API Key APIs.
 * If you need to apply the same update to many API keys, you can use the bulk update API keys API to reduce overhead.
 * It's not possible to update expired API keys or API keys that have been invalidated by the invalidate API key API.
 *
 * The access scope of an API key is derived from the `role_descriptors` you specify in the request and a snapshot of the owner user's permissions at the time of the request.
 * The snapshot of the owner's permissions is updated automatically on every call.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If you don't specify `role_descriptors` in the request, a call to this API might still change the API key's access scope.
 * This change can occur if the owner user's permissions have changed since the API key was created or last modified.
