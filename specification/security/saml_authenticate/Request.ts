/**
 * Authenticate SAML.
 *
 * Submit a SAML response message to Elasticsearch for consumption.
 *
 * NOTE: This API is intended for use by custom web applications other than Kibana.
 * If you are using Kibana, refer to the documentation for configuring SAML single-sign-on on the Elastic Stack.
 *
 * The SAML message that is submitted can be:
 *
 * * A response to a SAML authentication request that was previously created using the SAML prepare authentication API.
 * * An unsolicited SAML message in the case of an IdP-initiated single sign-on (SSO) flow.
 *
 * In either case, the SAML message needs to be a base64 encoded XML document with a root element of `<Response>`.
 *
 * After successful validation, Elasticsearch responds with an Elasticsearch internal access token and refresh token that can be subsequently used for authentication.
 * This API endpoint essentially exchanges SAML responses that indicate successful authentication in the IdP for Elasticsearch access and refresh tokens, which can be used for authentication against Elasticsearch.
