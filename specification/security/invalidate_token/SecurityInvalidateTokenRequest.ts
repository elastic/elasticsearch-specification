 * Invalidate a token.

 * The time period is defined by the `xpack.security.authc.token.timeout` setting.

 * The refresh tokens returned by the get token API are only valid for 24 hours. They can also be used exactly once.
 * If you want to invalidate one or more access or refresh tokens immediately, use this invalidate token API.
