/**
 * Update user profile data.
 *
 * Update specific data for the user profile that is associated with a unique ID.
 *
 * NOTE: The user profile feature is designed only for use by Kibana and Elastic's Observability, Enterprise Search, and Elastic Security solutions.
 * Individual users and external applications should not call this API directly.
 * Elastic reserves the right to change or remove this feature in future releases without prior notice.
 *
 * To use this API, you must have one of the following privileges:
 *
 * * The `manage_user_profile` cluster privilege.
 * * The `update_profile_data` global privilege for the namespaces that are referenced in the request.
 *
 * This API updates the `labels` and `data` fields of an existing user profile document with JSON objects.
 * New keys and their values are added to the profile document and conflicting keys are replaced by data that's included in the request.
 *
 * For both labels and data, content is namespaced by the top-level fields.
 * The `update_profile_data` global privilege grants privileges for updating only the allowed namespaces.
 * @rest_spec_name security.update_user_profile_data
