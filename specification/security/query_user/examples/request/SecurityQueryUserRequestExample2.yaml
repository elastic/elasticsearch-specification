summary: Query users with multiple conditions
# method_request: POST /_security/_query/user
description: >
  Run `POST /_security/_query/user`.
  Use a `bool` query to issue complex logical conditions:
  The `email` must end with `example.com`.
  The user must be enabled.
  The result will be filtered to only contain users with at least one role that contains the substring `other`.
  The offset to begin the search result is the second (zero-based index) user.
  The page size of the response is two users.
  The result is sorted by `username` in descending order.
