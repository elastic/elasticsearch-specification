summary: Query users with multiple conditions
method_request: POST /_security/_query/user
description: >
  Run `POST /_security/_query/user`. Use a `bool` query to issue complex logical conditions: The `email` must end with
  `example.com`. The user must be enabled. The result will be filtered to only contain users with at least one role that contains
  the substring `other`. The offset to begin the search result is the second (zero-based index) user. The page size of the response
  is two users. The result is sorted by `username` in descending order.
