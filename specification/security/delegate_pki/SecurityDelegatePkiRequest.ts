/**
 * Delegate PKI authentication.
 * This API implements the exchange of an X509Certificate chain for an Elasticsearch access token.
 * The certificate chain is validated, according to RFC 5280, by sequentially considering the trust configuration of every installed PKI realm that has `delegation.enabled` set to `true`.
 * A successfully trusted client certificate is also subject to the validation of the subject distinguished name according to thw `username_pattern` of the respective realm.
 *
 * This API is called by smart and trusted proxies, such as Kibana, which terminate the user's TLS session but still want to authenticate the user by using a PKI realm—-​as if the user connected directly to Elasticsearch.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The association between the subject public key in the target certificate and the corresponding private key is not validated.
 * This is part of the TLS authentication process and it is delegated to the proxy that calls this API.
 * The proxy is trusted to have performed the TLS authentication and this API translates that authentication into an Elasticsearch access token.
