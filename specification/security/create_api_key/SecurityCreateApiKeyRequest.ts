/**
 * Create an API key.

 * Create an API key for access without requiring basic authentication.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the credential that is used to authenticate this request is an API key, the derived API key cannot have any privileges.
 * If you specify privileges, the API returns an error.
 *
 * A successful request returns a JSON structure that contains the API key, its unique id, and its name.
 * If applicable, it also returns expiration information for the API key in milliseconds.
 *
 * NOTE: By default, API keys never expire. You can specify expiration information when you create the API keys.
 *
 * The API keys are created by the Elasticsearch API key service, which is automatically enabled.
 * To configure or turn off the API key service, refer to API key service setting documentation.

     * The derived API key can be used for authentication; it will not have authority to call Elasticsearch APIs.
