summary: Roles for specific groups
method_request: POST /_security/role_mapping/mapping4
description: >
  Run `POST /_security/role_mapping/mapping4` to match any user where either the username is `esadmin` or the user is in the
  `cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com group`. This example is useful when the group names in your identity management system (such as Active
  Directory, or a SAML Identity Provider) do not have a one-to-one correspondence with the names of roles in Elasticsearch. The role
  mapping is the means by which you link a group name with a role name.
