summary: Templated roles for groups
# method_request: POST /_security/role_mapping/mapping6
description: >
  Run `POST /_security/role_mapping/mapping6` for rare cases when the names of your groups may be an exact match for the names of your Elasticsearch roles.
  This can be the case when your SAML Identity Provider includes its own "group mapping" feature and can be configured to release Elasticsearch role names in the user's SAML attributes.
  In these cases it is possible to use a template that treats the group names as role names.

  NOTE: This should only be done if you intend to define roles for all of the provided groups. 
  Mapping a user to a large number of unnecessary or undefined roles is inefficient and can have a negative effect on system performance.
  If you only need to map a subset of the groups, you should do it by using explicit mappings.

  The `tojson` mustache function is used to convert the list of group names into a valid JSON array. Because the template produces a JSON array, the `format` must be set to `json`.
