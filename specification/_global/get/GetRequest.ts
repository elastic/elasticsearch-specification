/**
 * Get a document by its ID.
 *
 * Get a document and its source or stored fields from an index.
 *
 * By default, this API is realtime and is not affected by the refresh rate of the index (when data will become visible for search).
 * In the case where stored fields are requested with the `stored_fields` parameter and the document has been updated but is not yet refreshed, the API will have to parse and analyze the source to extract the stored fields.
 * To turn off realtime behavior, set the `realtime` parameter to false.
 *
 * **Source filtering**
 *
 * By default, the API returns the contents of the `_source` field unless you have used the `stored_fields` parameter or the `_source` field is turned off.
 * You can turn off `_source` retrieval by using the `_source` parameter:
 *
 * ```
 * GET my-index-000001/_doc/0?_source=false
 * ```
 *
 * If you only need one or two fields from the `_source`, use the `_source_includes` or `_source_excludes` parameters to include or filter out particular fields.
 * This can be helpful with large documents where partial retrieval can save on network overhead
 * Both parameters take a comma separated list of fields or wildcard expressions.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * GET my-index-000001/_doc/0?_source_includes=*.id&_source_excludes=entities
 * ```
 *
 * If you only want to specify includes, you can use a shorter notation:
 *
 * ```
 * GET my-index-000001/_doc/0?_source=*.id
 * ```
 *
 * **Routing**
 *
 * If routing is used during indexing, the routing value also needs to be specified to retrieve a document.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * GET my-index-000001/_doc/2?routing=user1
 * ```
 *
 * This request gets the document with ID 2, but it is routed based on the user.
 * The document is not fetched if the correct routing is not specified.
 *
 * **Distributed**
 *
 * The GET operation is hashed into a specific shard ID.
 * It is then redirected to one of the replicas within that shard ID and returns the result.
 * The replicas are the primary shard and its replicas within that shard ID group.
 * This means that the more replicas you have, the better your GET scaling will be.
 *
 * **Versioning support**
 *
 * You can use the `version` parameter to retrieve the document only if its current version is equal to the specified one.
 *
 * Internally, Elasticsearch has marked the old document as deleted and added an entirely new document.
 * The old version of the document doesn't disappear immediately, although you won't be able to access it.
 * Elasticsearch cleans up deleted documents in the background as you continue to index more data.
 * @rest_spec_name get
 * @availability stack stability=stable
 * @availability serverless stability=stable visibility=public
 * @index_privileges read
 * @doc_tag document
