/**
 * Update a document.
 *
 * Update a document by running a script or passing a partial document.
 *
 * If the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have the `index` or `write` index privilege for the target index or index alias.
 *
 * The script can update, delete, or skip modifying the document.
 * The API also supports passing a partial document, which is merged into the existing document.
 * To fully replace an existing document, use the index API.
 * This operation:
 *
 * * Gets the document (collocated with the shard) from the index.
 * * Runs the specified script.
 * * Indexes the result.
 *
 * The document must still be reindexed, but using this API removes some network roundtrips and reduces chances of version conflicts between the GET and the index operation.
 *
 * The `_source` field must be enabled to use this API.
 * In addition to `_source`, you can access the following variables through the `ctx` map: `_index`, `_type`, `_id`, `_version`, `_routing`, and `_now` (the current timestamp).
