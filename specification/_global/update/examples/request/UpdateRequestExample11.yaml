summary: Doc as upsert
# method_request: POST test/_update/1
description: >
  Run `POST test/_update/1` to perform a doc as upsert.
  Instead of sending a partial `doc` plus an `upsert` doc, you can set `doc_as_upsert` to `true` to use the contents of `doc` as the `upsert` value.
# type: request
value:
  "{\n  \"doc\": {\n    \"name\": \"new_name\"\n  },\n  \"doc_as_upsert\": true\n\
  }"
