summary: Doc as upsert
method_request: POST test/_update/1
description: >
  Run `POST test/_update/1` to perform a doc as upsert. Instead of sending a partial `doc` plus an `upsert` doc, you can set
  `doc_as_upsert` to `true` to use the contents of `doc` as the `upsert` value.
# type: request
value: "{

  \  \"doc\": {

  \    \"name\": \"new_name\"

  \  },

  \  \"doc_as_upsert\": true

  }"
