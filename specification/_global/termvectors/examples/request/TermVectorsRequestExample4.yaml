summary: Generate term vectors on the fly
# method_request: GET /my-index-000001/_termvectors/1
description: >
  Run `GET /my-index-000001/_termvectors/1`.
  Term vectors which are not explicitly stored in the index are automatically computed on the fly.
  This request returns all information and statistics for the fields in document 1, even though the terms haven't been explicitly stored in the index.
  Note that for the field text, the terms are not regenerated.
