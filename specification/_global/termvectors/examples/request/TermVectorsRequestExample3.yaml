summary: Terms filtering
method_request: GET /imdb/_termvectors
description: >
  Run `GET /imdb/_termvectors` to filter the terms returned based on their tf-idf scores. It returns the three most "interesting"
  keywords from the artificial document having the given "plot" field value. Notice that the keyword "Tony" or any stop words are
  not part of the response, as their tf-idf must be too low.
