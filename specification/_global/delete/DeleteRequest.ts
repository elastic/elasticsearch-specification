/**
 * Delete a document.
 *
 * Remove a JSON document from the specified index.
 *
 * NOTE: You cannot send deletion requests directly to a data stream.
 * To delete a document in a data stream, you must target the backing index containing the document.
 *
 * **Optimistic concurrency control**
 *
 * Delete operations can be made conditional and only be performed if the last modification to the document was assigned the sequence number and primary term specified by the `if_seq_no` and `if_primary_term` parameters.
 * If a mismatch is detected, the operation will result in a `VersionConflictException` and a status code of `409`.
 *
 * **Versioning**
 *
 * Each document indexed is versioned.
 * When deleting a document, the version can be specified to make sure the relevant document you are trying to delete is actually being deleted and it has not changed in the meantime.
 * Every write operation run on a document, deletes included, causes its version to be incremented.
 * The version number of a deleted document remains available for a short time after deletion to allow for control of concurrent operations.
 * The length of time for which a deleted document's version remains available is determined by the `index.gc_deletes` index setting.
 *
 * **Routing**
 *
 * If routing is used during indexing, the routing value also needs to be specified to delete a document.
 *
 * If the `_routing` mapping is set to `required` and no routing value is specified, the delete API throws a `RoutingMissingException` and rejects the request.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * ```
 * DELETE /my-index-000001/_doc/1?routing=shard-1
 * ```
 *
 * This request deletes the document with ID 1, but it is routed based on the user.
 * The document is not deleted if the correct routing is not specified.
 *
 * **Distributed**
 *
 * The delete operation gets hashed into a specific shard ID.
 * It then gets redirected into the primary shard within that ID group and replicated (if needed) to shard replicas within that ID group.
 * @rest_spec_name delete
 * @availability stack stability=stable
 * @availability serverless stability=stable visibility=public
 * @index_privileges delete
 * @doc_tag document
 * @doc_id docs-delete
