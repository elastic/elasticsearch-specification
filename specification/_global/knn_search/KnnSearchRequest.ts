/**
 * Run a knn search.
 *
 * NOTE: The kNN search API has been replaced by the `knn` option in the search API.
 *
 * Perform a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search on a dense_vector field and return the matching documents.
 * Given a query vector, the API finds the k closest vectors and returns those documents as search hits.
 *
 * Elasticsearch uses the HNSW algorithm to support efficient kNN search.
 * Like most kNN algorithms, HNSW is an approximate method that sacrifices result accuracy for improved search speed.
 * This means the results returned are not always the true k closest neighbors.
 *
 * The kNN search API supports restricting the search using a filter.
 * The search will return the top k documents that also match the filter query.
