/**
 * A search request by default executes against the most recent visible data of the target indices,
 * which is called point in time. Elasticsearch pit (point in time) is a lightweight view into the
 * state of the data as it existed when initiated. In some cases, itâ€™s preferred to perform multiple
 * search requests using the same point in time. For example, if refreshes happen between
 * `search_after` requests, then the results of those requests might not be consistent as changes happening
 * between searches are only visible to the more recent point in time.
