summary: Reindex multiple sources
# method_request: POST _reindex
description: >
  Run `POST _reindex` to reindex from multiple sources.
  The `index` attribute in source can be a list, which enables you to copy from lots of sources in one request.
  This example copies documents from the `my-index-000001` and `my-index-000002` indices.
