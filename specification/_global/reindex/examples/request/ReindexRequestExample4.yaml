summary: Routing
method_request: POST _reindex
description: >
  By default if reindex sees a document with routing then the routing is preserved unless it's changed by the script. You can set
  `routing` on the `dest` request to change this behavior. In this example, run `POST _reindex` to copy all documents from the
  `source` with the company name `cat` into the `dest` with routing set to `cat`.

  \  \"dest\": {
