summary: Routing
# method_request: POST _reindex
description: >
  By default if reindex sees a document with routing then the routing is preserved unless it's changed by the script.
  You can set `routing` on the `dest` request to change this behavior.
  In this example, run `POST _reindex` to copy all documents from the `source` with the company name `cat` into the `dest` with routing set to `cat`.
# type: request
value:
  "{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"index\": \"source\",\n    \"query\": {\n      \"\
  match\": {\n        \"company\": \"cat\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"dest\": {\n\
  \    \"index\": \"dest\",\n    \"routing\": \"=cat\"\n  }\n}"
