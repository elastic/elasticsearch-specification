/**
 * Reindex documents.
 *
 * Copy documents from a source to a destination.
 * You can copy all documents to the destination index or reindex a subset of the documents.
 * The source can be any existing index, alias, or data stream.
 * The destination must differ from the source.
 * For example, you cannot reindex a data stream into itself.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Reindex requires `_source` to be enabled for all documents in the source.
 * The destination should be configured as wanted before calling the reindex API.
 * Reindex does not copy the settings from the source or its associated template.
 * Mappings, shard counts, and replicas, for example, must be configured ahead of time.
 *
 * If the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have the following security privileges:
 *
 * * The `read` index privilege for the source data stream, index, or alias.
 * * The `write` index privilege for the destination data stream, index, or index alias.
 * * To automatically create a data stream or index with a reindex API request, you must have the `auto_configure`, `create_index`, or `manage` index privilege for the destination data stream, index, or alias.
 * * If reindexing from a remote cluster, the `source.remote.user` must have the `monitor` cluster privilege and the `read` index privilege for the source data stream, index, or alias.
 *
 * If reindexing from a remote cluster, you must explicitly allow the remote host in the `reindex.remote.whitelist` setting.
 * Automatic data stream creation requires a matching index template with data stream enabled.
 *
 * The `dest` element can be configured like the index API to control optimistic concurrency control.
 * Omitting `version_type` or setting it to `internal` causes Elasticsearch to blindly dump documents into the destination, overwriting any that happen to have the same ID.
 *
 * Setting `version_type` to `external` causes Elasticsearch to preserve the `version` from the source, create any documents that are missing, and update any documents that have an older version in the destination than they do in the source.
 *
 * Setting `op_type` to `create` causes the reindex API to create only missing documents in the destination.
 * All existing documents will cause a version conflict.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Because data streams are append-only, any reindex request to a destination data stream must have an `op_type` of `create`.
 * A reindex can only add new documents to a destination data stream.
 * It cannot update existing documents in a destination data stream.
 *
 * By default, version conflicts abort the reindex process.
 * To continue reindexing if there are conflicts, set the `conflicts` request body property to `proceed`.
 * In this case, the response includes a count of the version conflicts that were encountered.
 * Note that the handling of other error types is unaffected by the `conflicts` property.
 * Additionally, if you opt to count version conflicts, the operation could attempt to reindex more documents from the source than `max_docs` until it has successfully indexed `max_docs` documents into the target or it has gone through every document in the source query.
 *
 * Refer to the linked documentation for examples of how to reindex documents.
