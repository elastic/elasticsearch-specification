/**
 * Get the cluster health.
 * Get a report with the health status of an Elasticsearch cluster.
 * The report contains a list of indicators that compose Elasticsearch functionality.
 *
 * Each indicator has a health status of: green, unknown, yellow or red.
 * The indicator will provide an explanation and metadata describing the reason for its current health status.
 *
 * The cluster’s status is controlled by the worst indicator status.
 *
 * In the event that an indicator’s status is non-green, a list of impacts may be present in the indicator result which detail the functionalities that are negatively affected by the health issue.
 * Each impact carries with it a severity level, an area of the system that is affected, and a simple description of the impact on the system.
 *
 * Some health indicators can determine the root cause of a health problem and prescribe a set of steps that can be performed in order to improve the health of the system.
 * The root cause and remediation steps are encapsulated in a diagnosis.
 * A diagnosis contains a cause detailing a root cause analysis, an action containing a brief description of the steps to take to fix the problem, the list of affected resources (if applicable), and a detailed step-by-step troubleshooting guide to fix the diagnosed problem.
 *
 * NOTE: The health indicators perform root cause analysis of non-green health statuses. This can be computationally expensive when called frequently.
 * When setting up automated polling of the API for health status, set verbose to false to disable the more expensive analysis logic.
