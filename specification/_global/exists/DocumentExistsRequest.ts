/**
 * Check a document.
 *
 * Verify that a document exists.
 * For example, check to see if a document with the `_id` 0 exists:
 *
 * ```
 * HEAD my-index-000001/_doc/0
 * ```
 *
 * If the document exists, the API returns a status code of `200 - OK`.
 * If the document doesnâ€™t exist, the API returns `404 - Not Found`.
 *
 * **Versioning support**
 *
 * You can use the `version` parameter to check the document only if its current version is equal to the specified one.
 *
 * Internally, Elasticsearch has marked the old document as deleted and added an entirely new document.
 * The old version of the document doesn't disappear immediately, although you won't be able to access it.
 * Elasticsearch cleans up deleted documents in the background as you continue to index more data.
 * @rest_spec_name exists
