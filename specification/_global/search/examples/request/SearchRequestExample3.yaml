summary: Search slicing
# method_request: GET /_search
description: >
  When paging through a large number of documents, it can be helpful to split the search into multiple slices to consume them independently.
  The result from running the first `GET /_search` request returns documents belonging to the first slice (`id: 0`).
  If you run a second request with `id` set to `1', it returns documents in the second slice.
  Since the maximum number of slices is set to `2`, the union of the results is equivalent to the results of a point-in-time search without slicing.
