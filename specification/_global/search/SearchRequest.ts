/**
 * Run a search.
 *
 * Get search hits that match the query defined in the request.
 * You can provide search queries using the `q` query string parameter or the request body.
 * If both are specified, only the query parameter is used.
 *
 * If the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, you must have the read index privilege for the target data stream, index, or alias. For cross-cluster search, refer to the documentation about configuring CCS privileges.
 * To search a point in time (PIT) for an alias, you must have the `read` index privilege for the alias's data streams or indices.
 *
 * **Search slicing**
 *
 * When paging through a large number of documents, it can be helpful to split the search into multiple slices to consume them independently with the `slice` and `pit` properties.
 * By default the splitting is done first on the shards, then locally on each shard.
 * The local splitting partitions the shard into contiguous ranges based on Lucene document IDs.
 *
 * For instance if the number of shards is equal to 2 and you request 4 slices, the slices 0 and 2 are assigned to the first shard and the slices 1 and 3 are assigned to the second shard.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The same point-in-time ID should be used for all slices.
 * If different PIT IDs are used, slices can overlap and miss documents.
 * This situation can occur because the splitting criterion is based on Lucene document IDs, which are not stable across changes to the index.
