/**
 * Run a scrolling search.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The scroll API is no longer recommend for deep pagination. If you need to preserve the index state while paging through more than 10,000 hits, use the `search_after` parameter with a point in time (PIT).
 *
 * The scroll API gets large sets of results from a single scrolling search request.
 * To get the necessary scroll ID, submit a search API request that includes an argument for the `scroll` query parameter.
 * The `scroll` parameter indicates how long Elasticsearch should retain the search context for the request.
 * The search response returns a scroll ID in the `_scroll_id` response body parameter.
 * You can then use the scroll ID with the scroll API to retrieve the next batch of results for the request.
 * If the Elasticsearch security features are enabled, the access to the results of a specific scroll ID is restricted to the user or API key that submitted the search.
 *
 * You can also use the scroll API to specify a new scroll parameter that extends or shortens the retention period for the search context.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Results from a scrolling search reflect the state of the index at the time of the initial search request. Subsequent indexing or document changes only affect later search and scroll requests.
