/**
 * Run a script.
 *
 * Runs a script and returns a result.
 * Use this API to build and test scripts, such as when defining a script for a runtime field.
 * This API requires very few dependencies and is especially useful if you don't have permissions to write documents on a cluster.
 *
 * The API uses several _contexts_, which control how scripts are run, what variables are available at runtime, and what the return type is.
 *
 * Each context requires a script, but additional parameters depend on the context you're using for that script.
