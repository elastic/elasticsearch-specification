summary: Filter context
method_request: POST /_scripts/painless/_execute
description: >
  Run `POST /_scripts/painless/_execute` with a `filter` context. It treats scripts as if they were run inside a script query. For
  testing purposes, a document must be provided so that it will be temporarily indexed in-memory and is accessible from the script.
  More precisely, the `_source`, stored fields, and doc values of such a document are available to the script being tested.
