summary: Dynamic templates
method_request: POST /_bulk
description: >
  Run `POST /_bulk` to perform a bulk request that consists of index and create actions with the `dynamic_templates` parameter. The
  bulk request creates two new fields `work_location` and `home_location` with type `geo_point` according to the `dynamic_templates`
  parameter. However, the `raw_location` field is created using default dynamic mapping rules, as a text field in that case since it
  is supplied as a string in the JSON document.
# type: request
value:
  '{ "index" : { "_index" : "my_index", "_id" : "1", "dynamic_templates": {"work_location": "geo_point"}} }

  { "field" : "value1", "work_location": "41.12,-71.34", "raw_location": "41.12,-71.34"}

  { "create" : { "_index" : "my_index", "_id" : "2", "dynamic_templates": {"home_location": "geo_point"}} }

  { "field" : "value2", "home_location": "41.12,-71.34"}'
