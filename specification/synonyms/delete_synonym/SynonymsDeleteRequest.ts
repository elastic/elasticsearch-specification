/**
 * Delete a synonym set.
 *
 * You can only delete a synonyms set that is not in use by any index analyzer.
 *
 * Synonyms sets can be used in synonym graph token filters and synonym token filters.
 * These synonym filters can be used as part of search analyzers.
 *
 * Analyzers need to be loaded when an index is restored (such as when a node starts, or the index becomes open).
 * Even if the analyzer is not used on any field mapping, it still needs to be loaded on the index recovery phase.
 *
 * If any analyzers cannot be loaded, the index becomes unavailable and the cluster status becomes red or yellow as index shards are not available.
 * To prevent that, synonyms sets that are used in analyzers can't be deleted.
 * A delete request in this case will return a 400 response code.
 *
 * To remove a synonyms set, you must first remove all indices that contain analyzers using it.
 * You can migrate an index by creating a new index that does not contain the token filter with the synonyms set, and use the reindex API in order to copy over the index data.
 * Once finished, you can delete the index.
 * When the synonyms set is not used in analyzers, you will be able to delete it.
