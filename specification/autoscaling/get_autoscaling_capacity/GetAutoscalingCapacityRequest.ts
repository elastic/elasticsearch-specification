/**
 * Get the autoscaling capacity.
 *
 * NOTE: This feature is designed for indirect use by Elasticsearch Service, Elastic Cloud Enterprise, and Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes. Direct use is not supported.
 *
 * This API gets the current autoscaling capacity based on the configured autoscaling policy.
 * It will return information to size the cluster appropriately to the current workload.
 *
 * The `required_capacity` is calculated as the maximum of the `required_capacity` result of all individual deciders that are enabled for the policy.
 *
 * The operator should verify that the `current_nodes` match the operatorâ€™s knowledge of the cluster to avoid making autoscaling decisions based on stale or incomplete information.
 *
 * The response contains decider-specific information you can use to diagnose how and why autoscaling determined a certain capacity was required.
 * This information is provided for diagnosis only.
 * Do not use this information to make autoscaling decisions.
 * @rest_spec_name autoscaling.get_autoscaling_capacity
 * @availability stack since=7.11.0 stability=stable
