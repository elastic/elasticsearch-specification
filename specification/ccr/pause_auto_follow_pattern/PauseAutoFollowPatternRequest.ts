 * Pause an auto-follow pattern.
 * Pause a cross-cluster replication auto-follow pattern.
 * When the API returns, the auto-follow pattern is inactive.
 * New indices that are created on the remote cluster and match the auto-follow patterns are ignored.
 *
 * You can resume auto-following with the resume auto-follow pattern API.
 * When it resumes, the auto-follow pattern is active again and automatically configures follower indices for newly created indices on the remote cluster that match its patterns.
 * Remote indices that were created while the pattern was paused will also be followed, unless they have been deleted or closed in the interim.
