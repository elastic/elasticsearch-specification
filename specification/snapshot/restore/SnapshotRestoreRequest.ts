/**
 * Restore a snapshot.
 * Restore a snapshot of a cluster or data streams and indices.
 *
 * You can restore a snapshot only to a running cluster with an elected master node.
 * The snapshot repository must be registered and available to the cluster.
 * The snapshot and cluster versions must be compatible.
 *
 * To restore a snapshot, the cluster's global metadata must be writable. Ensure there are't any cluster blocks that prevent writes. The restore operation ignores index blocks.
 *
 * Before you restore a data stream, ensure the cluster contains a matching index template with data streams enabled. To check, use the index management feature in Kibana or the get index template API:
 *
 * ```
 * GET _index_template/*?filter_path=index_templates.name,index_templates.index_template.index_patterns,index_templates.index_template.data_stream
 * ```
 *
 * If no such template exists, you can create one or restore a cluster state that contains one. Without a matching index template, a data stream can't roll over or create backing indices.
 *
 * If your snapshot contains data from App Search or Workplace Search, you must restore the Enterprise Search encryption key before you restore the snapshot.
