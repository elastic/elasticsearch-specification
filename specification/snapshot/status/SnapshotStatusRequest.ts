/**
 * Get the snapshot status.
 * Get a detailed description of the current state for each shard participating in the snapshot.
 *
 * Note that this API should be used only to obtain detailed shard-level information for ongoing snapshots.
 * If this detail is not needed or you want to obtain information about one or more existing snapshots, use the get snapshot API.
 *
 * If you omit the `<snapshot>` request path parameter, the request retrieves information only for currently running snapshots.
 * This usage is preferred.
 * If needed, you can specify `<repository>` and `<snapshot>` to retrieve information for specific snapshots, even if they're not currently running.
 *
 * WARNING: Using the API to return the status of any snapshots other than currently running snapshots can be expensive.
 * The API requires a read from the repository for each shard in each snapshot.
 * For example, if you have 100 snapshots with 1,000 shards each, an API request that includes all snapshots will require 100,000 reads (100 snapshots x 1,000 shards).
 *
 * Depending on the latency of your storage, such requests can take an extremely long time to return results.
 * These requests can also tax machine resources and, when using cloud storage, incur high processing costs.
