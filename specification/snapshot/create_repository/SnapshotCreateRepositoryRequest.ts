 * Create or update a snapshot repository.
 * IMPORTANT: If you are migrating searchable snapshots, the repository name must be identical in the source and destination clusters.
 * To register a snapshot repository, the cluster's global metadata must be writeable.
 * Ensure there are no cluster blocks (for example, `cluster.blocks.read_only` and `clsuter.blocks.read_only_allow_delete` settings) that prevent write access.
 *
 * Several options for this API can be specified using a query parameter or a request body parameter.
 * If both parameters are specified, only the query parameter is used.
