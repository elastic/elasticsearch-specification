/**
 * Creates the enrich index for an existing enrich policy.
 * The enrich index contains documents from the policyâ€™s source indices. Enrich 
 * indices always begin with `.enrich-*`, are read-only, and are force merged.
 * Enrich indices should be used by the enrich processor only. Avoid using 
 * enrich indices for other purposes.
 * Once created, you cannot update or index documents to an enrich index. 
 * Instead, update your source indices and execute the enrich policy again. This 
 * creates a new enrich index from your updated source indices. The previous 
 * enrich index will deleted with a delayed maintenance job. By default this is 
 * done every 15 minutes. 
 * Because this API request performs several operations, it may take a while to 
 * return a response.
