/**
 * Create or update a watch.
 * When a watch is registered, a new document that represents the watch is added to the `.watches` index and its trigger is immediately registered with the relevant trigger engine.
 * Typically for the `schedule` trigger, the scheduler is the trigger engine.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: You must use Kibana or this API to create a watch.
 * Do not add a watch directly to the `.watches` index by using the Elasticsearch index API.
 * If Elasticsearch security features are enabled, do not give users write privileges on the `.watches` index.
 *
 * When you add a watch you can also define its initial active state by setting the *active* parameter.
 *
 * When Elasticsearch security features are enabled, your watch can index or search only on indices for which the user that stored the watch has privileges.
 * If the user is able to read index `a`, but not index `b`, the same will apply when the watch runs.
