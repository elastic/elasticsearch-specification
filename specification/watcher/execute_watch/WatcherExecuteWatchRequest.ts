/**
 * Run a watch.
 * This API can be used to force execution of the watch outside of its triggering logic or to simulate the watch execution for debugging purposes.
 *
 * For testing and debugging purposes, you also have fine-grained control on how the watch runs.
 * You can run the watch without running all of its actions or alternatively by simulating them.
 * You can also force execution by ignoring the watch condition and control whether a watch record would be written to the watch history after it runs.
 *
 * You can use the run watch API to run watches that are not yet registered by specifying the watch definition inline.
 * This serves as great tool for testing and debugging your watches prior to adding them to Watcher.
 *
 * When Elasticsearch security features are enabled on your cluster, watches are run with the privileges of the user that stored the watches.
 * If your user is allowed to read index `a`, but not index `b`, then the exact same set of rules will apply during execution of a watch.
 *
 * When using the run watch API, the authorization data of the user that called the API will be used as a base, instead of the information who stored the watch.
