summary: Run a watch
# method_request: POST _watcher/watch/my_watch/_execute
description: >
  Run `POST _watcher/watch/my_watch/_execute` to run a watch.
  The input defined in the watch is ignored and the `alternative_input` is used as the payload.
  The condition as defined by the watch is ignored and is assumed to evaluate to true.
  The `force_simulate` action forces the simulation of `my-action`.
  Forcing the simulation means that throttling is ignored and the watch is simulated by Watcher instead of being run normally.
