summary: Run a watch
method_request: POST _watcher/watch/my_watch/_execute
description: >
  Run `POST _watcher/watch/my_watch/_execute` to run a watch. The input defined in the watch is ignored and the `alternative_input`
  is used as the payload. The condition as defined by the watch is ignored and is assumed to evaluate to true. The `force_simulate`
  action forces the simulation of `my-action`. Forcing the simulation means that throttling is ignored and the watch is simulated by
  Watcher instead of being run normally.
