/**
 * Acknowledge a watch.
 * Acknowledging a watch enables you to manually throttle the execution of the watch's actions.
 *
 * The acknowledgement state of an action is stored in the `status.actions.<id>.ack.state` structure.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: If the specified watch is currently being executed, this API will return an error
 * The reason for this behavior is to prevent overwriting the watch status from a watch execution.
 *
 * Acknowledging an action throttles further executions of that action until its `ack.state` is reset to `awaits_successful_execution`.
 * This happens when the condition of the watch is not met (the condition evaluates to false).
