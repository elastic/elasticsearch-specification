summary: A live shard recovery
description: >
  A successful response from `GET _cat/recovery?v=true&h=i,s,t,ty,st,shost,thost,f,fp,b,bp&format=json`.
  You can retrieve information about an ongoing recovery for example when you increase the replica count of an index and bring another node online to host the replicas.
  In this example, the recovery type is `peer`, meaning the shard recovered from another node.
  The `files` and `bytes` are real-time measurements.
