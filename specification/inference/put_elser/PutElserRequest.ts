/**
 * Create an ELSER inference endpoint.
 *
 * Create an inference endpoint to perform an inference task with the `elser` service.
 * You can also deploy ELSER by using the Elasticsearch inference integration.
 *
 * > info
 * > Your Elasticsearch deployment contains a preconfigured ELSER inference endpoint, you only need to create the enpoint using the API if you want to customize the settings.
 *
 * The API request will automatically download and deploy the ELSER model if it isn't already downloaded.
 *
 * > info
 * > You might see a 502 bad gateway error in the response when using the Kibana Console. This error usually just reflects a timeout, while the model downloads in the background. You can check the download progress in the Machine Learning UI. If using the Python client, you can set the timeout parameter to a higher value.
 *
 * After creating the endpoint, wait for the model deployment to complete before using it.
 * To verify the deployment status, use the get trained model statistics API.
 * Look for `"state": "fully_allocated"` in the response and ensure that the `"allocation_count"` matches the `"target_allocation_count"`.
 * Avoid creating multiple endpoints for the same model unless required, as each endpoint consumes significant resources.
 * @rest_spec_name inference.put_elser
 * @availability stack since=8.11.0 stability=stable visibility=public
 * @availability serverless stability=stable visibility=public
 * @deprecated 8.16.0 The elser service is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the Elasticsearch inference integration instead, with model_id included in the service_settings.
