/**
 * Update an inference endpoint.
 *
 * Modify `task_settings`, secrets (within `service_settings`), or `num_allocations` for an inference endpoint, depending on the specific endpoint service and `task_type`.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The inference APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in machine learning models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Azure, Google AI Studio, Google Vertex AI, Anthropic, Watsonx.ai, or Hugging Face.
 * For built-in models and models uploaded through Eland, the inference APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage trained models.
 * However, if you do not plan to use the inference APIs to use these models or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the machine learning trained model APIs.
