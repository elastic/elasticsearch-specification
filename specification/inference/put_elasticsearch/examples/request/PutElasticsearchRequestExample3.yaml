summary: E5 text embedding task
description:
  Run `PUT _inference/text_embedding/my-e5-model` to create an inference endpoint that performs a `text_embedding` task.
  The `model_id` must be the ID of one of the built-in E5 models. The API will automatically download the E5 model if it isn't
  already downloaded and then deploy the model.
