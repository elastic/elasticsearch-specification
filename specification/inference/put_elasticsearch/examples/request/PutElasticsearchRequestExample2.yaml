summary: Elastic rerank task
description:
  Run `PUT _inference/rerank/my-elastic-rerank` to create an inference endpoint that performs a rerank task using the
  built-in Elastic Rerank cross-encoder model.  The `model_id` must be `.rerank-v1`, which is the ID of the built-in Elastic Rerank
  model. The API will automatically download the Elastic Rerank model if it isn't already downloaded and then deploy the model. Once
  deployed, the model can be used for semantic re-ranking with a `text_similarity_reranker` retriever.
