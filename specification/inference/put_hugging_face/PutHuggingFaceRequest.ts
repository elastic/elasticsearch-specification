/**
 * Create a Hugging Face inference endpoint.
 *
 * Create an inference endpoint to perform an inference task with the `hugging_face` service.
 *
 * You must first create an inference endpoint on the Hugging Face endpoint page to get an endpoint URL.
 * Select the model you want to use on the new endpoint creation page (for example `intfloat/e5-small-v2`), then select the sentence embeddings task under the advanced configuration section.
 * Create the endpoint and copy the URL after the endpoint initialization has been finished.
 *
 * The following models are recommended for the Hugging Face service:
 *
 * * `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
 * * `all-MiniLM-L12-v2`
 * * `all-mpnet-base-v2`
 * * `e5-base-v2`
 * * `e5-small-v2`
 * * `multilingual-e5-base`
 * * `multilingual-e5-small`
