/**
 * Create a custom inference endpoint.
 *
 * The custom service gives more control over how to interact with external inference services that aren't explicitly supported through dedicated integrations.
 * The custom service gives you the ability to define the headers, url, query parameters, request body, and secrets.
 * The custom service supports the template replacement functionality, which enables you to define a template that can be replaced with the contents of a value that defines that key.
 * Templates are portions of a string that start with `${` and end with `}`.
 * The parameters `secret_parameters` and `task_settings` are checked for keys for template replacement. Template replacement is supported in the `request`, `headers`, `url`, and `query_parameters`.
 * If the definition (key) is not found for a template, an error message is returned.
 * In case of an endpoint definition like the following:
 * ```
 * PUT _inference/text_embedding/test-text-embedding
 * {
 *   "service": "custom",
 *   "service_settings": {
 *      "secret_parameters": {
 *           "api_key": "<some api key>"
 *      },
 *      "url": "...endpoints.huggingface.cloud/v1/embeddings",
 *      "headers": {
 *          "Authorization": "Bearer ${api_key}",
 *          "Content-Type": "application/json"
 *      },
 *      "request": "{\"input\": ${input}}",
 *      "response": {
 *          "json_parser": {
 *              "text_embeddings":"$.data[*].embedding[*]"
 *          }
 *      }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 * To replace `${api_key}` the `secret_parameters` and `task_settings` are checked for a key named `api_key`.
 *
 * > info
 * > Templates should not be surrounded by quotes.
 *
 * Pre-defined templates:
 * * `${input}` refers to the array of input strings that comes from the `input` field of the subsequent inference requests.
 * * `${input_type}` refers to the input type translation values.
 * * `${query}` refers to the query field used specifically for reranking tasks.
 * * `${top_n}` refers to the `top_n` field available when performing rerank requests.
 * * `${return_documents}` refers to the `return_documents` field available when performing rerank requests.
