/**
 * Create an JinaAI inference endpoint.
 *
 * Create an inference endpoint to perform an inference task with the `jinaai` service.
 *
 * To review the available `rerank` models, refer to <https://jina.ai/reranker>.
 * To review the available `text_embedding` models, refer to the <https://jina.ai/embeddings/>.
 *
 * When you create an inference endpoint, the associated machine learning model is automatically deployed if it is not already running.
 * After creating the endpoint, wait for the model deployment to complete before using it.
 * To verify the deployment status, use the get trained model statistics API.
 * Look for `"state": "fully_allocated"` in the response and ensure that the `"allocation_count"` matches the `"target_allocation_count"`.
 * Avoid creating multiple endpoints for the same model unless required, as each endpoint consumes significant resources.
