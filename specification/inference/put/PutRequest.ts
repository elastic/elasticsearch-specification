/**
 * Create an inference endpoint.
 * When you create an inference endpoint, the associated machine learning model is automatically deployed if it is not already running.
 * After creating the endpoint, wait for the model deployment to complete before using it.
 * To verify the deployment status, use the get trained model statistics API.
 * Look for `"state": "fully_allocated"` in the response and ensure that the `"allocation_count"` matches the `"target_allocation_count"`.
 * Avoid creating multiple endpoints for the same model unless required, as each endpoint consumes significant resources.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: The inference APIs enable you to use certain services, such as built-in machine learning models (ELSER, E5), models uploaded through Eland, Cohere, OpenAI, Mistral, Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, Google Vertex AI, Anthropic, Watsonx.ai, or Hugging Face.
 * For built-in models and models uploaded through Eland, the inference APIs offer an alternative way to use and manage trained models.
 * However, if you do not plan to use the inference APIs to use these models or if you want to use non-NLP models, use the machine learning trained model APIs.
