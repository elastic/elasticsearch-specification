/**
 * Create or update a query ruleset.
 * There is a limit of 100 rules per ruleset.
 * This limit can be increased by using the `xpack.applications.rules.max_rules_per_ruleset` cluster setting.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Due to limitations within pinned queries, you can only select documents using `ids` or `docs`, but cannot use both in single rule.
 * It is advised to use one or the other in query rulesets, to avoid errors.
 * Additionally, pinned queries have a maximum limit of 100 pinned hits.
 * If multiple matching rules pin more than 100 documents, only the first 100 documents are pinned in the order they are specified in the ruleset.
