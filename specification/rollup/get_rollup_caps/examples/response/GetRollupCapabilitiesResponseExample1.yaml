# summary:
description: >
  A successful response from `GET _rollup/data/sensor-*` for a rollup job that targets the index pattern `sensor-*`.
  The response contains the rollup job ID, the index that holds the rolled data, and the index pattern that the job was targeting.
  It also shows a list of fields that contain data eligible for rollup searches.
  For example, you can use a `min`, `max`, or `sum` aggregation on the `temperature` field, but only a `date_histogram` on `timestamp`.
