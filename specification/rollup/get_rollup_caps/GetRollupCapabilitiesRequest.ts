/**
 * Get the rollup job capabilities.
 * Get the capabilities of any rollup jobs that have been configured for a specific index or index pattern.
 *
 * This API is useful because a rollup job is often configured to rollup only a subset of fields from the source index.
 * Furthermore, only certain aggregations can be configured for various fields, leading to a limited subset of functionality depending on that configuration.
 * This API enables you to inspect an index and determine:
 *
 * 1. Does this index have associated rollup data somewhere in the cluster?
 * 2. If yes to the first question, what fields were rolled up, what aggregations can be performed, and where does the data live?
