/**
 * Stop rollup jobs.
 * If you try to stop a job that does not exist, an exception occurs.
 * If you try to stop a job that is already stopped, nothing happens.
 *
 * Since only a stopped job can be deleted, it can be useful to block the API until the indexer has fully stopped.
 * This is accomplished with the `wait_for_completion` query parameter, and optionally a timeout. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * POST _rollup/job/sensor/_stop?wait_for_completion=true&timeout=10s
 * ```
 * The parameter blocks the API call from returning until either the job has moved to STOPPED or the specified time has elapsed.
 * If the specified time elapses without the job moving to STOPPED, a timeout exception occurs.
