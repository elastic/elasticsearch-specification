summary: Pipeline substitions
method_request: POST /_ingest/_simulate
description:
  In this example the index `my-index` has a default pipeline called `my-pipeline` and a final pipeline called
  `my-final-pipeline`. But a substitute definition of `my-pipeline` is provided in `pipeline_substitutions`. The substitute
  `my-pipeline` will be used in place of the `my-pipeline` that is in the system, and then the `my-final-pipeline` that is already
  defined in the system will run.
