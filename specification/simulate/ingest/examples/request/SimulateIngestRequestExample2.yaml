summary: Pipeline substitions
# method_request: POST /_ingest/_simulate
description: In this example the index `my-index` has a default pipeline called `my-pipeline` and a final pipeline called `my-final-pipeline`. But a substitute definition of `my-pipeline` is provided in `pipeline_substitutions`. The substitute `my-pipeline` will be used in place of the `my-pipeline` that is in the system, and then the `my-final-pipeline` that is already defined in the system will run.
