summary: Existing pipeline definitions
method_request: POST /_ingest/_simulate
description:
  In this example the index `my-index` has a default pipeline called `my-pipeline` and a final pipeline called
  `my-final-pipeline`. Since both documents are being ingested into `my-index`, both pipelines are run using the pipeline
  definitions that are already in the system.
