# summary:
method_request: POST clicklogs/_graph/explore
description: >
  Run `POST clicklogs/_graph/explore` for a basic exploration An initial graph explore query typically begins with a query to
  identify strongly related terms. Seed the exploration with a query. This example is searching `clicklogs` for people who searched
  for the term `midi`.Identify the vertices to include in the graph. This example is looking for product codes that are
  significantly associated with searches for `midi`. Find the connections. This example is looking for other search terms that led
  people to click on the products that are associated with searches for `midi`.
