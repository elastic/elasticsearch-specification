 * Explore graph analytics.
 * Extract and summarize information about the documents and terms in an Elasticsearch data stream or index.
 * The easiest way to understand the behavior of this API is to use the Graph UI to explore connections.
 * An initial request to the `_explore` API contains a seed query that identifies the documents of interest and specifies the fields that define the vertices and connections you want to include in the graph.
 * Subsequent requests enable you to spider out from one more vertices of interest.
 * You can exclude vertices that have already been returned.
