/**
 * Move to a lifecycle step.
 * Manually move an index into a specific step in the lifecycle policy and run that step.
 *
 * WARNING: This operation can result in the loss of data. Manually moving an index into a specific step runs that step even if it has already been performed. This is a potentially destructive action and this should be considered an expert level API.
 *
 * You must specify both the current step and the step to be executed in the body of the request.
 * The request will fail if the current step does not match the step currently running for the index
 * This is to prevent the index from being moved from an unexpected step into the next step.
 *
 * When specifying the target (`next_step`) to which the index will be moved, either the name or both the action and name fields are optional.
 * If only the phase is specified, the index will move to the first step of the first action in the target phase.
 * If the phase and action are specified, the index will move to the first step of the specified action in the specified phase.
 * Only actions specified in the ILM policy are considered valid.
 * An index cannot move to a step that is not part of its policy.
