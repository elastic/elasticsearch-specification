/**
 * Migrate to data tiers routing.
 * Switch the indices, ILM policies, and legacy, composable, and component templates from using custom node attributes and attribute-based allocation filters to using data tiers.
 * Optionally, delete one legacy index template.
 * Using node roles enables ILM to automatically move the indices between data tiers.
 *
 * Migrating away from custom node attributes routing can be manually performed.
 * This API provides an automated way of performing three out of the four manual steps listed in the migration guide:
 *
 * 1. Stop setting the custom hot attribute on new indices.
 * 1. Remove custom allocation settings from existing ILM policies.
 * 1. Replace custom allocation settings from existing indices with the corresponding tier preference.
 *
 * ILM must be stopped before performing the migration.
 * Use the stop ILM and get ILM status APIs to wait until the reported operation mode is `STOPPED`.
